#### Case Background and Parties Involved
- The case of Leung Ben v. O'Brien involves a dispute between Leung Ben and P.J. O'Brien.
- Leung Ben is the plaintiff in the case.
- P.J. O'Brien is the defendant in the case.
- The dispute revolves around the validity of an attachment issued by the Court of First Instance in the Philippines.

#### Allegations and Request for Attachment
- P.J. O'Brien alleges that Leung Ben owes him P15,000, which he lost to Ben in a series of gambling games.
- O'Brien files a complaint against Ben for the recovery of the alleged debt.
- O'Brien requests an attachment against Ben's property, claiming that Ben is about to leave the Philippines with the intent to defraud his creditors.

#### Granting of Attachment and Seizure of Money
- The Court of First Instance grants the attachment requested by O'Brien.
- The attachment allows for the seizure of money from Ben's bank account.

#### Petition for Writ of Certiorari
- Leung Ben files a petition for a writ of certiorari.
- Ben argues that the attachment was issued without statutory authority.
- Ben claims that he has no other adequate remedy.

#### Main Questions Addressed by the Supreme Court
- The Supreme Court of the Philippines hears the case and addresses two main questions:
    1. Whether the Court of First Instance exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the attachment.
    2. Whether the obligation to return money won in gambling constitutes an implied contract.

#### Jurisdiction and Issuance of Attachment
- The Supreme Court determines that if a Court of First Instance issues an attachment without statutory authority, it is acting irregularly and in excess of its jurisdiction.
- In such cases, the Supreme Court can entertain a petition for a writ of certiorari to quash the attachment.
- The Court clarifies that there is a distinction between a court's jurisdiction over the main cause of action and its jurisdiction to grant an auxiliary remedy like attachment.
- Even if a court has jurisdiction over the main cause of action, it may still act irregularly or in excess of its jurisdiction in granting an attachment.

#### Implied Contract and Validity of Attachment
- The Court holds that the obligation to return money won in gambling is an implied contract as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure.
- The Code allows for the issuance of an attachment in an action for the recovery of money on a cause of action arising upon contract, express or implied.
- Since the cause of action in this case arose upon an implied contract, the Court rules that the attachment was valid and would not be annulled.

#### Supreme Court Decision
- The Supreme Court denies Ben's petition for a writ of certiorari.
- The Court upholds the validity of the attachment issued by the Court of First Instance.
- The Court determines that the duty to return money won in gambling is an implied contract, and the court had the authority to issue the attachment.
