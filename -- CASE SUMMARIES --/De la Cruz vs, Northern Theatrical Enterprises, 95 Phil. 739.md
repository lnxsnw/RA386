#### Case Background and Facts
- The case involves Domingo De la Cruz, a special guard, seeking reimbursement for legal expenses and moral damages from his former employer, Northern Theatrical Enterprises Inc.
- De la Cruz was charged with homicide after an altercation with a gate crasher named Benjamin Martin, whom he shot and killed in self-defense.
- De la Cruz incurred legal expenses while going through two criminal cases before being acquitted in 1948.

#### De la Cruz's Lawsuit and Trial Court Decision
- De la Cruz filed a lawsuit against Northern Theatrical Enterprises Inc. and its board of directors, demanding reimbursement for his legal expenses and moral damages.
- The trial court dismissed the complaint, stating that De la Cruz had no cause of action.

#### Main Issue: Employee's Right to Recover Damages from Employer
- The main issue in the case is whether an employee can recover damages from their employer for expenses incurred due to the actions of a third party while performing their duties.
- The court rules that, under present legislation, an employee cannot recover damages from their employer in such a situation.
- While it may be a moral obligation for the employer to provide legal assistance to employees charged criminally, it is not a legal obligation.

#### Employer's Lack of Involvement in Criminal Proceedings
- The court considers the argument that the damages suffered by De la Cruz were caused by the improper filing of the criminal charge, possibly at the instance of the deceased gate crasher's heirs and the State through the Fiscal.
- If there is any civil responsibility for damages, it should be placed on these parties, not the employer who had no involvement in the criminal proceedings.
- The damages incurred by De la Cruz were not directly caused by his act of shooting the gate crasher but by the filing of the criminal charge.
- Therefore, there was an efficient, intervening cause that breaks the chain of causation between the employee's actions and the damages suffered.

#### Supreme Court Decision
- The Supreme Court affirms the decision of the trial court, ruling that the employer is not liable for the damages incurred by the employee.
- The court emphasizes that while it may be a moral obligation for the employer to provide legal assistance, it does not have the sanction of man-made laws.
