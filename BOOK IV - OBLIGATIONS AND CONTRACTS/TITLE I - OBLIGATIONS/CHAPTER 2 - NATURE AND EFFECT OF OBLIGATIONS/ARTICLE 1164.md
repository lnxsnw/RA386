### Different kinds of fruits.
The fruits mentioned by the law refer to natural, industrial, and civil fruits.

- (1) *Natural fruits* are the spontaneous products of the soil, and the young and other products of animals.
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > Grass; all trees and plants on lands produced without the intervention of human labor.
- (2) *Industrial fruits* are those produced by lands of any kind through cultivation or labor.
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > Sugar cane; vegetables; rice; and all products of lands brought about by reason of human labor.
- (3) *Civil fruits* are those derived by virtue of a juridical relation.
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > Rents of buildings, price of leases of lands and other property and the amount of perpetual or life annuities or other similar income. ([[ARTICLE 442]].)

### Right of creditor to the fruits.
The creditor is entitled to the fruits of the thing to be delivered from the time the obligation to make delivery arises.

The intention of the law is to protect the interest of the obligee should the obligor commit delay, purposely or otherwise, in the fulfillment of his obligation.

### When obligation to deliver fruits arises.
- (1) Generally, the obligation to deliver the thing due and, consequently, the fruits thereof, if any, arises from the time of the “perfection of the contract.” Perfection, in this case, refers to the birth of the contract or to the meeting of the minds between the parties. ([[ARTICLE 1305]], [[ARTICLE 1315]], [[ARTICLE 1319]].)
- (2) If the obligation is subject to a suspensive condition or period ([[ARTICLE 1179]], [[ARTICLE 1189]], [[ARTICLE 1193]].), it arises upon the fulfillment of the condition or arrival of the term. However, the parties may make a stipulation to the contrary as regards the right of the creditor to the fruits of the thing.
- (3) In a contract of sale, the obligation arises from the perfection of the contract even if the obligation is subject to a suspensive condition or a suspensive period where the price has been paid.
- (4) In obligations to give arising from law, quasi-contracts, delicts, and quasi-delicts, the time of performance is determined by the specific provisions of the law applicable.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> S sold his horse to B for P15,000, No date or condition was stipulated for the delivery of the horse. While still in the possession of S, the horse gave birth to a colt.
>
> Who has a right to the colt?
>
> In a contract of sale “all the fruits shall pertain to the vendee from the day on which the contract was perfected.” ([[ARTICLE 1537]], 2nd par.) Hence, B is entitled to the colt. This holds true even if the delivery is subject to a suspensive condition (e.g., upon the demand of B) or a suspensive period (e.g., next month) if B has paid the price,
>
> But S has a right to the colt if it was born before the obligation to deliver the horse has arisen (Art. 1164.) and B has not yet paid the purchase price. In this case, upon the fulfillment of the condition or the arrival of the period, S does not have to give the colt and B is not obliged to pay legal interest on the price since the colt and the interest are deemed to have been mutually compensated. (see [[ARTICLE 1187]].)

### Meaning of personal right and real right.
- (1) *Personal right* is the right or power of a person (creditor) to demand from another (debtor), as a definite passive subject, the fulfillment of the latter's obligation to give, to do, or not to do.
- (2) *Real right* is the right or interest of a person over a specific thing (like ownership, possession, mortgage), without a definite passive subject against whom the right may be personally enforced.

### Personal right and real right distinguished.
- (1) In personal right there is a definite active subject and a definite passive subject, while in real right, there is only a definite active subject without any definite passive subject. (see [[ARTICLE 1156]].)
- (2) A personal right is, therefore, binding or enforceable only against a particular person, while a real right is directed against the whole world. (see next example.)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X is the owner of a parcel of land under a torrens title registered in his name in the Registry of Property. His ownership is a real right directed against everybody. There is no definite passive subject.
> 
> If the land is claimed by Y who takes possession, X has a personal right to recover from Y, as a definite passive subject, the property.
> 
> If the same land is mortgaged by X to Z, the mortgage, if duly registered, is binding against third persons. A purchaser buys the land subject to mortgage which is a real right.

### Ownership acquired by delivery.
Ownership and other real rights over property are acquired and transmitted in consequence of certain contracts by tradition ([[ARTICLE 712]].) or delivery. In sale, for example, mere agreement on the terms thereof does not effect transfer of ownership of the thing sold in the absence of delivery, actual or constructive, of the thing.

The meaning of the phrase “he shall acquire no real right over it until the same has been delivered to him,” is that the creditor does not become the owner until the specific thing has been delivered to him. Hence, when there has been no delivery yet, the proper court action of the creditor is not one for recovery of possession and ownership but one for specific performance or rescission of the obligation. (see [[ARTICLE 1165]].)


> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> S is obliged to give to B on July 25 a particular horse. Before July 25, B has no right over the horse. B will acquire a personal right against S to fulfill his obligation only from July 25.
>
> If the horse is delivered on July 30, B acquires ownership or real right only from that date. But if on July 20, S sold and delivered the same horse to C, a third person (meaning that he is not a party to the contract between S and B) who acted in good faith (without knowledge of the said contract), C acquires ownership over the horse and he shall be entitled to it as against B. S shall be liable to B for damages. ([[ARTICLE 1170]].)
