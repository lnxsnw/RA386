### Responsibility arising from fraud demandable.
This provision refers to incidental fraud which is employed in the fulfillment of an obligation. ([[ARTICLE 1170]].)

Responsibility arising from fraud can be demanded with respect to all kinds of obligation and unlike in the case of responsibility arising from negligence ([[ARTICLE 1172]]), the court is not given the power to mitigate or reduce the damages to be awarded. This is so because fraud is deemed serious and evil that its employment to avoid the fulfillment of oneâ€™s obligation should be discouraged.

### Waiver of action for future fraud void
According to the time of commission, fraud may be past or future.

A waiver of an action for future fraud is void (no effect, as if there is no waiver) as being against the law and public policy. ([[ARTICLE 1409]][1].) A contrary rule would encourage the perpetration of fraud because the obligor knows that even if he should commit fraud, he would not be liable for it, thus making the obligation illusory.

### Waiver of action for past fraud valid
What the law prohibits is waiver anterior to the fraud and to the knowledge thereof by the aggrieved party.

A past fraud can be the subject of a valid waiver because the waiver can be considered as an act of generosity and magnanimity on the part of the party who is the victim of the fraud. Here, what is renounced is the effect of the fraud, that is, the right to indemnity of the party entitled thereto. The waiver must be expressed in clear language which leaves no doubt as to the intention of the obligee to give up his right against  the obligor.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> S promised to deliver 120 cavans of rice of a particular brand and quality to B at the rate of 10 cavans a month.
>
> S cannot make an agreement with B, whereby B will not file an action in court against S, should S commit fraud in the performance of his obligation. This waiver of an action for future fraud is void. Hence, B can still bring an action against S for damages arising from the fraud.
>
> But once fraud is committed, B, with full knowledge thereof, can waive his right to indemnity as an act of forgiveness on his part.
