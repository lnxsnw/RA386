### Remedies available to creditors for the satisfaction of their claims. 
In case the debtor does not comply with his obligation, the creditor may avail himself of the following remedies to satisfy his claim: 

- (1) exact fulfillment (specific performance) with the right to damages; 
- (2) pursue the leviable (not exempt from attachment, under the law) property of the debtor;
- (3) "after having pursued the property in possession of the debtor," exercise all the rights 	(like the right to redeem) and bring all the actions of the debtor (like the right to collect from 	the debtor of his debtor) except those inherent in or personal to the person of the latter 	(such as the right to vote, to hold office, to receive legal support, to revoke a donation on the 	ground of ingratitude, etc.); and 
- (4) ask the court to rescind or impugn acts or contracts which the debtor may have done to 	defraud him when he cannot in any other manner recover his claim. (see Arts. 1380-1389.) 

The debtor is liable with all his property, present and future, for the fulfillment of his obligations, subject to the exemptions provided by law. (see [[ARTICLE 2236]].) 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> On the due date, D could not pay C his obligation in the amount of P400,000. However, D owns a car worth about P280,000 and X is indebted to him for P40,000. Before the due date of the obligation, D sold his land worth P200,000 to Y.
>
> Under the circumstances, the rights granted to C under the law are as follows: 
>
> - (a) He may bring an action for the collection of the amount of P400,000 with a right to damages. 
> - (b) If (b) If, in spite of the judgment rendered, D fails to pay the amount due, C can ask for the attachment of D's car so that the car may be sold and payment made from the proceeds of the sale. 
>
> - (c) He may ask the court to order X not to pay D so that payment may be made to him (C). 
>
> - (d) He may ask the court to rescind or cancel the sale made by D to Y on the ground that the transaction is fraudulent in case he (C) cannot recover in any other manner his credit. 
>
> The last remedy can be resorted to only if C could not collect in full his credit. (see [[ARTICLE 1381]][3], [[ARTICLE 1387]].) He must first exhaust the properties of the debtor or subrogate (see [[ARTICLE 1300]].) himself in the latter's transmissible rights.
