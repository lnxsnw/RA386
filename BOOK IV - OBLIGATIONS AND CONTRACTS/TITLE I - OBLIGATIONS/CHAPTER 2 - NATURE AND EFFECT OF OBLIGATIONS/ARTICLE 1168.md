### Remedies of creditor in negative personal obligation.
In an obligation not to do, the duty of the obligor is to abstain from an act. Here, there is no specific performance. The very obligation is fulfilled in not doing what is forbidden. Hence, in this kind of obligation the debtor cannot be guilty of delay. ([[ARTICLE 1169]])

As a rule, the remedy of the obligee is the undoing of the forbidden things plus damages. ([[ARTICLE 1170]]). However, if it is not possible to undo what was done, either physically or legally, or because of the rights acquired by third persons who aced in good faith, or for some other reason, his remedy is an action for damages caused by the debtor’s violation of his obligation.


> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> B brought a land from S. It was stipulated that S would not construct a fence on a certain portion of his land adjoining that sold to B.
> 
> Should S construct a fence in violation of the agreement, B can bring an action to have the fence removed at the expense of S.
