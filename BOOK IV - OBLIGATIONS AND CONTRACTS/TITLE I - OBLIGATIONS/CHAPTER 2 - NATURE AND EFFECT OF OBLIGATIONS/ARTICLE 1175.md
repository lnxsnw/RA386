### Meaning of simple loan or mutuum. 
Simple loan or mutuum is a contract whereby one of the parties delivers to another, money or other consumable thing, upon the condition that the same amount of the same kind and quality shall be paid. It may be gratuitous or with a stipulation to pay interest. ([[ARTICLE. 1933]].) 

### Meaning of usury.
Usury is contracting for or receiving interest in excess of the amount allowed by law for the loan or use of money, goods, chattels or credits. ([[Tolentino vs. Gonzales, 50 Phil. 558]].)

### Requisites for recovery of interest. 
In order that interest may be recovered, the following requisites must be present: 
- (1) The payment of interest must be expressly stipulated ([[ARTICLE 1956]].);
- (2) The agreement must be in writing; and 
- (3) The interest must be lawful. ([[ARTICLE 1957]].) 

A stipulation for the payment of usurious interest is void, that is, as if there is no stipulation as to interest. (see comments under [[ARTICLE 1413]].) The lender may still recover the principal of the loan and demand compliance with other terms of the contract otherwise valid. 

Note: By virtue, however, of [Central Bank, Circular No. 905 (Dec. 10, 1982, effective Jan. 1, 1983.) ](https://www.pinayjurist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R.A.-CBP-CIRCULAR-NO-905.pdf)issued by the Monetary Board under the authority granted to it by the Usury Law, the rate of interest and other charges on a loan or forbearance of money, goods, or credit, regardless of maturity and whether secured or unsecured, that may be charged or collected shall not be subject to any ceiling prescribed under the Usury Law. Usury is now legally non-existent. Parties are now free to stipulate any amount of interest. It does not, however, give absolute right to the creditor to charge the debtor interest that is "iniquitous or unconscionable." (see [[ARTICLE 1229]].)
