### Meaning of specific or determinate thing.
The above provision refers to an obligation specific or determinate thing.

A thing is said to be *specific* or *determinate* particularly designated or physically segregated from others of the same class. ([[ARTICLE 1459]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) the watch I am wearing.
> - (2) the car sold by X.
> - (3) my dog named “Terror.”
> - (4) the house at the corner of Rizal and del Pilar Streets.
> - (5) the Toyota car with Plate No. AAV 316 (2008).
> - (6) this cavan of rice.
> - (7) the money I gave you.

### Meaning of generic or indeterminate thing,
A thing is *generic* or *indeterminate* when it refers only to a class or *genus* to which it pertains and cannot be pointed out with particularity.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) a Bulova calendar watch.
> - (2) the sum of P1,000.
> - (3) a 2016 Toyota car.
> - (4) a cavan of rice.
> - (5) a police dog.

### Specific thing and generic thing distinguished.
- (1) A determinate thing is identified by its individuality. The debtor cannot substitute it with another although the latter is of the same kind and quality without the consent of the creditor. ([[ARTICLE 1244]].)
- (2) A generic thing is identified only by its specie. The debtor can give anything of the same class as long as it is of the same kind.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) If S‘s obligation is to deliver to B a Rolex calendar watch, S can deliver any watch as long as it is a Rolex with calendar.
>
> >  But if S's obligation is to deliver to B a particular watch, the one S is wearing, S cannot substitute it with another watch without B's consent nor can B require S to deliver another watch without S's consent although it may be of the same kind and value. (see Arts, 1244, 1246.)
>
> - (2) If S's obligation is to deliver to B one of his cars, the object refers to a class which in itself is determinate.
> 
> > Here, the particular thing to be delivered is determinable without the need of a new contract between the parties (see [[ARTICLE 1349]].); it becomes determinate upon its delivery.

### Duties of debtor In obligation to give a determinate thing.
They are:

- (1) *Preserve or take care of the thing*. — In obligations to give (real obligations), the obligor has the incidental duty to take care of the thing due with the diligence of a good father of a family pending delivery.

    - (a) *Diligence of a good father of a family*. — The phrase has been equated with *ordinary care* or that diligence which an average (a reasonably prudent) person exercises over his own property.

    - (b) *Another standard of care*. — However, if the law or the stipulation of the parties provides for another standard of care (slight or extraordinary diligence), said law or stipulation must prevail. ([[ARTICLE 1163]].)
    
        Under the law, for instance, a common carrier (person or company engaged in the transportation of persons and/or cargoes) is “bound to carry the passengers safely as far as human care and foresight can provide, using utmost (i.e., extraordinary) diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the circumstances.” ([[ARTICLE 1755]].) In case of accident, therefore, the common carrier will be liable if it exercised only ordinary diligence or the diligence of a good father of a family.

        The parties may agree upon diligence which is more or less than that of a good father of a family but it is contrary to public policy (see [[ARTICLE 1306]].) to stipulate for absolute exemption from liability of the obligor for any fault or negligence on his part. (see [[ ARTICLE 1173]], [[ARTICLE 1174]].)

    - (c) *Factors to be considered*. — The diligence required necessarily depends upon the nature of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of the person, of the time, and of the place. ([[ARTICLE 1173]].) It is not necessarily the standard of care one always uses in the protection of his property. As a general rule, the debtor is not liable if his failure to preserve the thing is not due to his fault or negligence but to fortuitous events or force majeure. ([[ARTICLE 1174]].)

	    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
	    > S binds himself to deliver a specific horse to B on a certain date. Pending delivery, S has the additional or accessory duty to take care of the horse with the diligence of a good father of a family, like feeding the horse regularly, keeping it in a safe place, etc. In other words, S must exercise that diligence which he would exercise over another horse belonging to him and which he is not under obligation to deliver to B.
	    > 
	    > But S cannot relieve himself from liability in case of loss by claiming that he exercised the same degree of care toward the horse as he would toward his own, if such care is less than that required by the circumstances. If the horse dies or is lost or becomes sick as a consequence of S's failure to exercise proper diligence, he shall be liable to B for damages.
	    > 
	    > The accessory obligation of S to take care of the horse is demandable even if no mention thereof is made in the contract.

	- (d) *Reason for debtor's obligation*. — The debtor must exercise diligence to insure that the thing to be delivered would subsist in the same condition as it was when the obligation was contracted. Without the accessory duty to take care of the thing, the debtor would be able to afford being negligent and he would not be liable even if the property is lost or destroyed, thus rendering illusory the obligation to give ([8 Manresa, 35-37](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522113949/https://www.uma.es/spanish-philippine-law-archive/navegador_de_ficheros/Law/descargar/Manresa/comentarios_Al_Codigo_Civil_Manresa_T08.pdf).);

- (2) *Deliver the fruits of the thing*. — This is discussed under [[ARTICLE 1164]];
- (3) *Deliver the accessions and accessories*. — This is discussed under [[ARTICLE 1166]];
- (4) *Deliver the thing itself*. — ([[ARTICLE 1163]], [[ARTICLE 1233]], [[ARTICLE 1244]]; as to kinds of delivery, see Arts. 1497 to 1501.); and
- (5) *Answer for damages in case of non-fulfillment or breach*. — This is discussed under [[ARTICLE 1170]].

### Duties of debtor in obligation to deliver a generic thing.
They are:

- (1) To deliver a thing which is of the quality intended by the parties taking into consideration the purpose of the obligation and other circumstances (see [[ARTICLE 1246]].); and
- (2) To be liable for damages in case of fraud, negligence, or delay, in the performance of his obligation, or contravention of the tenor thereof. (see [[ARTICLE 1170]].)
