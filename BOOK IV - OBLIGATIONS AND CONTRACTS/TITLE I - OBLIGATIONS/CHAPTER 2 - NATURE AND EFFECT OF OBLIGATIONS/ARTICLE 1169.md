# Those obliged to deliver or to do something incur in delay from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands from them the fulfillment of their obligation. However, the demand by the creditor shall not be necessary in order that delay may exist: (1) When the obligation or the law expressly so declares; or (2) When from the nature and the circumstances of the obligation it appears that the designation of the time when the thing is to be delivered or the service is to be rendered was a controlling motive for the establishment of the contract; or (3) When demand would be useless, as when the obligor has rendered it beyond his power to perform. In reciprocal obligations, neither party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with what is incumbent upon him. From the moment one of the parties fulfills his obligation, delay by the other begins. (1100a)

> [!summary] Specifies that delay occurs when a person obliged to deliver or do something fails to fulfill the obligation after judicial or extrajudicial demand, except in cases where demand is unnecessary due to express declaration, the nature of the obligation, or when demand would be useless. In reciprocal obligations, delay occurs when one party performs, and the other fails to comply properly.

> [!example]- Case Examples
> Delay after demand
> ```
> A is obligated to deliver goods to B but fails to do so even after B formally demands delivery; A is in delay.
> ```
> No demand necessary
> ```
> 1. The contract between C and D states that payment is due on the 1st of each month. If D fails to pay, D is automatically in delay. 
> 2. E is contracted to perform at a specific event; failure to appear on time puts E in delay due to the time-sensitive nature.
> 3. F sells his property that he promised to deliver to G, making it impossible to fulfill the obligation; F is in delay without the need for demand.
> ```
> Reciprocal obligations
> ```
> H agrees to deliver a product, and I agrees to pay upon delivery. I is ready but I fails to pay; I is in delay. Once I pays, H’s failure to deliver on time will constitute delay.

### Meaning of Delay
The word *delay*, as used in the law, is not to be understood according to its meaning in common parlance. A distinction, therefore, should be made between ordinary delay and legal delay (default or *mora*) in the performance of an obligation.

- (1) *Ordinary delay* is merely the failure to perform an obligation on time.
- (2) *Legal delay* or *default* or *mora* is the failure to perform an obligation on time which failure constitutes a breach of the obligation.

### Kinds of delay or default
They are:

- (1) *Mora solvendi* or the delay on the part of the debtor to fulfill his obligation (to give or to do);
- (2) *Mora accipiendi* or the delay on the part of the creditor to accept the performance of the obligation; and
- (3) *Compensatio morae* or the delay of the obligors in reciprocal obligations (like in sale), i.e., the delay of the obligor cancels the delay of the obligee, and vice-versa. The net result is that there is no actionable default on the part of both parties.

### No delay in negative personal obligation.
In an obligation not to do, non-fulfillment may take place but delay is impossible for the debtor fulfills by not doing what has been forbidden him. (see [[ARTICLE 1168]].)

### Requisites of delay or default by the debtor.
There are three (3) conditions that must be present before *mora solvendi* can exist or its effects may arise:

- (1) failure of the debtor to perform his (positive) obligation on the date agreed upon;
- (2) demand (not mere reminder or notice) made by the creditor upon the debtor to comply with his obligation which demand may be either judicial (when a complaint is filed in court) or extrajudicial (when made outside of court, orally or in writing); and
- (3) failure of the debtor to comply with such demand.

The above presupposes that the obligation is already due or demandable. (see [[ARTICLE 1279]][4].) The creditor has the burden of proving that demand has been made. Similarly, it is incumbent upon the debtor to prove that the delay was no caused by his fault to relieve himself from liability. (see [[ARTICLE 1173]], [[ARTICLE 1174]].)


> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> S obliged himself to deliver to B a specific refrigerator on December 10.
>
> If S does not deliver the refrigerator on December 10, he is only in ordinary delay in the absence of any demand from B although a period had been fixed for the fulfillment of the obligation. The law presumes that B is giving S an extension of time within which to deliver the refrigerator. Hence, there is no breach of the obligation and S is not liable for damages.
>
> If a demand is made upon S by B on December 15 and S fails to deliver the refrigerator, S is considered in default only from the date.

If an action for specific performance is filed by B on December 20, the payment of damages for the default must commence on December 15 when he made the extrajudicial demand and not on December 20. In the absence of evidence, as to such extrajudicial demand, the effects of default arise from the date of the judicial demand, that is, from the filing of the complaint.

### Effects of delay.

- (1) *Mora solvendi*. — The following are the effects:
    - (a) The debtor is guilty of breach or violation of the obligation;
    - (b) He is liable to the creditor for interest (in case of obligations to pay money) ([[ARTICLE 2209]].) or damages (in other obligations). ([[ARTICLE 1170]].) In the absence of extrajudicial demand, the interest shall commence from the filing of the complaint; and 
    - (c) He is liable even for a fortuitous event when the obligation is to deliver a determinate thing. ([[ARTICLE 1165]], [[ARTICLE 1170]].) However, if the debtor can prove that the loss would have resulted just the same even if he had not been in default, the court may equitably mitigate or reduce the damages. ([[ARTICLE 2215]][4].)
    
    In an obligation to deliver a generic thing, the debtor is not relieved from liability for loss due to a fortuitous event. He can still be compelled to deliver a thing of thee same kind (see [[ARTICLE 1263]].) or held liable for damages. ([[ARTICLE 1170]].)

- (2) *Mora accipiendi*. — The effects are as follows:
    - (a) The creditor is guilty of breach of obligation;
    - (b) He is liable for damages suffered, if any, by the debtor;
    - (c) He bears the risk of loss of the thing due (see [[ARTICLE 1262]].);
    - (d) Where the obligation is to pay money, the debtor is not liable for interest from the time of the creditor’s delay; and
    - (e) The debtor may release himself from the obligation by the consignation or deposit in court of the thing or sum due. (see [[ARTICLE 1256]].)

- (3) *Compensatio morae*. — The delay of the obligor cancels the delay of the obligee and vice-versa. Legally, speaking, there is no default or delay on the part of both parties.
	
	If the delay of one (1) party is followed by that of the other, the liability of the first infractor shall be equitably tempered or balanced by the courts. If it cannot be determined which of the parties is guilty of delay, the contract shall be deemed extinguished and each shall bear his own damages. ([[ARTICLE 1192]].)

### When demand is not necessary to put debtor in delay.
As a general rule, delay by the debtor begins only from the moment a demand, judicial or extrajudicial, for the fulfillment of the former’s obligation is made by the creditor. Without such amount, the effect of default will not arise. The exceptions are mentioned below.

- (1) *When the obligation so provides*. —
	
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > D promised to pay C the sum of P20,000 on or before November 30 *without the need of any demand*. Therefore, if D fails to pay on November 30, he is automatically in default.
    >
    > In this case, the parties stipulate to dispense with the demand.
    
    The mere fixing of the period is not enough. The arrival of the period merely make the obligation demandable. Before its arrival, the creditor cannot demand performance. The obligation must expressly so declare that demand is not necessary or must use words to that effect, as for instance, “the debtor will be in default” or “I will be liable for damages.”
	
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > The contract of loan between D and C provides that failure of D to pay any installment therein stipulated would mature the entire obligation. It does not state that in such an event, D shall thereafter be in default.
    >
    > Demand is still necessary to hold D in default upon failure to pay any such installments. He is not liable for interest for default for the whole debt except from the time that judicial or extrajudicial demand for payment is made upon him.

- (2) *When the law so provides*. —
	
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > (1) Under the law, taxes should be paid on or before a specific date; otherwise, penalties and surcharges are imposed without the need of demand for payment by the government.
    >
    > (2) The partner is liable for the fruits of the thing he may have promised to contribute to the partnership from the time they should have been delivered without the need of any demand. ([[ARTICLE 1786]]; see [[ARTICLE 1788]].)

- (3) *When time is of the essence*. —
	
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > The delivery of balloons on a particular date when a children’s party will be held; the making of a wedding dress where the wedding is scheduled at a certain time; payment of money at a particular time so that the creditor could pay off certain debts due on the same date; the delivery of a car to be used in a trip at a particular time; etc.
	
    In all the foregoing cases, the debtor is fully aware that the performance of the obligation after the designated time would no longer benefit the creditor. In agreements of this kind, time element is important as performance itself. When the time of performance is not fixed or is stated in general or indefinite terms, time is, as a rule, not of the essence of the contract in which case performance must be made within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.
	
    It is not necessary for the contract to categorically state that time is of the essence; intent is sufficient.

- (4) *When demand would be useless*. —
    
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > S obliged himself to deliver a specific horse to B on September 5. Through S’s negligence or deliberate act, or by reason of fortuitous event for which S has expressly bound himself responsible (see [[ARTICLE 1174]].), the horse died on September 2.
    >
    > Under this situation, any demand for the delivery of the horse on September 5 would be useless as S has made it impossible for him to perform his obligation.
    >
    > Demand is also unnecessary where it is apparent that it would be unavailing, as where there has been a prior absolute refusal by S or S has manifested an intention not to comply with his obligation.

- (5) *When there is performance by a party in reciprocal obligations*. — In case of reciprocal obligations, the performance of one is conditioned upon the simultaneously fulfillment on the part of the other. So neither party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a proper manner with what is incumbent upon him. This is *compensatio morae*. 
	
    From the moment, however, a party fulfills or is ready to fulfill his obligation, delay by the other begins.
	
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > (1) S agreed to sell to B his television set for P10,000. The obligation of S is to deliver the television set while that of B, to pay P10,000.
    >
    > Since no date is set for performance of their respective obligations, it is understood that it must be simultaneous. S cannot demand payment if he himself cannot deliver the television set. From the moment S deliver the television set, B is in default if he does not pay S, without the need of any demand.
    >
	> (2) If the agreement is that the delivery and payment shall be made on December 10, the delivery (payment) by S (B) on December 5 does not give him the right to demand payment (delivery) from B (S). Neither party will incur delay before December 10 notwithstanding that the other has already complied with his obligation.
    > 
    > Here, performance is set on the same date.
    >
	> (3) Suppose in the same example, the delivery is to be made on December 10 and the payment, on December 15.
    >
    > In this case, a demand on December 10 by B is necessary to put S in delay following the general rule. (par. 1, Art. 1169.) Similarly, the delivery of television set by S does not put B in delay until a demand is made upon him on December 15, or subsequently. In this case, performance is set on different dates.
