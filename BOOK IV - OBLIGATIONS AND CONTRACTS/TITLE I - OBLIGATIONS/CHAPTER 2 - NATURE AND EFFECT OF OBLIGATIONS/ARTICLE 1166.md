### Meaning of accessions and accessories.

- (1) *Accessions* are the fruits of a thing or additions to or improvements upon a thing (the principal).
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > House or trees on a land; rents of a building; airconditioner in a car; profits or dividends accruing from shares of stocks, etc.
- (2) *Accessories* are things joined to or included with the principal thing for the latter's embellishment, better use, or completion.
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > Key of a house; frame of a picture; bracelet of a watch; machinery in a factory; bow of a violin.

Note that while accessions are not necessary to the principal thing, the accessory and the principal thing must go together. Both can exist only in relation to the principal. Accession is also used in the sense of a right, i.e., right to the fruits and/or accessories of a thing.

The general rule is that all accessions and accessories are considered included in the obligation to deliver a determinate thing although they may not have been mentioned, This rule is based on the principle of law that the accessory follows the principal. In order that they will be excluded, there must be 4 stipulation to that effect.

Unless otherwise stipulated, an obligation to deliver the accessions or accessories of a thing does not include the latter, Thus, a sale of the improvements (e.g., house) upon a land is not sufficient to convey title or any right to the land. But the lease of a building or house naturally includes the lease of the lot on which it is constructed for the possession of the lot is implied in the lease of the improvement.
