# When what is to be delivered is a determinate thing, the creditor, in addition to the right granted him by article 1170, may compel the debtor to make the delivery. If the thing is indeterminate or generic, he may ask that the obligation be complied with at the expense of the debtor. If the obligor delays, or has promised to deliver the same thing to two or more persons who do not have the same interest, he shall be responsible for any fortuitous event until he has effected the delivery. (1096)

> [!summary] Provides that if the obligation involves a determinate thing, the creditor can compel delivery; if the thing is indeterminate, compliance can be demanded at the debtor's expense. If the debtor delays or promises the same thing to multiple parties, he bears the risk of fortuitous events until delivery.

### Remedies of creditor in real obligation.

- (1) In a *specific real obligation* (obligation to deliver a determinate thing), the creditor may exercise the following remedies or rights in case the debtor fails to comply with his obligation:
	- (a) demand specific performance or fulfillment (if it is still possible) of the obligation with a right to indemnity for damages; or
	- (b) demand rescission or cancellation (in certain cases) of the obligation also with a right to recover damages ([[ARTICLE 1170]].); or
	- (c) demand payment of damages only, where it is the only feasible remedy.
	
	In an obligation to deliver a determinate thing, the very thing itself must be delivered. ([[ARTICLE 1244]].) Consequently, only the debtor can comply with the obligation. This is the reason why the creditor is granted the right to compel the debtor to make the delivery. (par. 1, Art. 1165.)
	
	It should be made clear, however, that the law does not mean that the creditor can use force or violence upon the debtor. The creditor must bring the matter to court and the court will be the one to order the delivery.
	
	> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
	> S sells his piano to B for P20,000. If S refuses to comply with his obligation to deliver the piano, B can bring an action for fulfillment or rescission of the obligation with the payment of damages in either case. ([[ARTICLE 1191]].) In case of rescission, the parties must return to each other what they have received. ([[ARTICLE 1385]].)
	>
	> The rights to demand fulfillment and rescission with damages (see [[ARTICLE 1170]].) are alternative, not cumulative, i.e., the election of one is a waiver of the right to resort to the other. (see [[ARTICLE 1191]].) B may bring an action for damages only even if this is not expressly mentioned by Article 1165. (see [[ARTICLE 1170]].)

- (2) A *generic real obligation* (obligation to deliver a generic thing), on the other hand, can be performed by a third person since the object is expressed only according to its family or *genus*. It is, thus, not necessary for the creditor to compel the debtor to make the delivery, although he may ask for performance of the obligation.[^3] In any case, the creditor has the right to recover damages under [[ARTICLE 1170]] in case of breach or violation of the obligation.

	The manner of compliance with an obligation to deliver a generic thing is governed by [[ARTICLE 1246]].

	> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
	> S obliges himself to deliver to B 100 sacks of rice on December 4 for P100,000.
	>
	> If S does not comply with his obligation, B may buy rice from C, a third person. If B paid C P10,000, he may recover (assuming B has not yet paid S) P10,000 from S. Furthermore, B can also hold S liable for damages in view of [[ARTICLE 1170]] as in the case of the delivery of a determinate thing. (par. 1.)

### Where debtor delays or has promised delivery to separate creditors.

Paragraph 3 gives two (2) instances when a fortuitous event does not exempt the debtor from responsibility. It likewise refers to a determinate thing. An indeterminate thing cannot be the object of destruction by a fortuitous event because *genus nunquam perit* (genus never perishes). (see [[ARTICLE 1174]], [[ARTICLE 1263]].)

Delay is discussed in Article 1169, and fortuitous events, in [[ARTICLE 1174]].

[^3]: Under the Constitution, no person shall be imprisoned for non-payment of debt. [(Art. III, Sec. 20 thereof.)](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/) However a person may be subject to subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of civil liability adjudged in a criminal case. (see [[ARTICLE 1161]].) The constitutional prohibition refers to purely civil debt or one arising from contractual obligations only.
