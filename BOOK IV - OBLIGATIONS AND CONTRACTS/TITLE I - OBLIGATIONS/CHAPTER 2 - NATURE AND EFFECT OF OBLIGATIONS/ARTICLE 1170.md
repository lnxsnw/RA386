### Grounds for liability.
The above provision gives the four (4) ground for liability which may entitle the injured party to damages (infra; see [[ARTICLE 2197]].) for all kinds of obligations mentioned in [[ARTICLE 1157]]. Here, the breach of the obligation is voluntary; in [[ARTICLE 1174]], it is involuntary. There is breach when a person fails or refuses to perform his obligation without legal justification.

- (1) *Fraud* (*deceit* or *dolo*). — As used in Article 1170, it is the deliberate or intentional evasion of the normal fulfillment of an obligation. (see [8 Manresa 72](https://web.archive.org/web/20220522113949/https://www.uma.es/spanish-philippine-law-archive/navegador_de_ficheros/Law/descargar/Manresa/comentarios_Al_Codigo_Civil_Manresa_T08.pdf).) As a ground for damages, it implies some kind of malice or dishonesty and it cannot cover cases of mere mistake and errors of judgement made in good faith. It is synonymous to bad faith in that, it involves a design to mislead or deceive another.

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > S obliged himself to deliver to B 20 bottles of wine, of a particular brand. Subsequently, S delivered 20 bottles knowing that they contain cheaper wine. S is guilty of fraud and is liable for damages to B.

    Article 1170 refers to *incidental fraud* (*dolo incidente*) committed in the performance of an obligation already existing because of contract. It is to be differentiated from *causal fraud* (*dolo causante*) or fraud employed in the execution of a contract under [[ARTICLE 1338]], which vitiates consent.

    In the same example, if B bought the 20 bottles of wine on the false representation of S that the wine is that as represented by the labels, the fraud committed by S is causal fraud. Without the fraud, B would not have given his consent to the contract. He has the right to have the contract annulled or set aside on the ground of the fraud. ([[ARTICLE 1390]], [[ARTICLE 1391]])

    But in the first example, the remedy of B is not annulment of the contract of sale which is not affected by the incidental fraud but to claim damages. If the fraud employed by S to get B’s consent was not the principal inducement that led B to enter into the contract, the fraud is also incidental and it will likewise give rise only to an action for damages. (see par. 2, [[ARTICLE 1344]].)

- (2) *Negligence* (*fault* or *culpa*). — It is any voluntary act or omission, there being no bad faith or malice, which prevents the normal fulfillment of an obligation. (see [[ARTICLE 1173]], [[ARTICLE 1174]].) It is the failure to exercise that degree of care required by the circumstances. (see [[ARTICLE 1173]].)

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > P is a passenger in a taxi. Here, there is considered a contract of carriage between P and the owner of the taxi company. In consideration of the fare to be paid by P, the owner of the taxi company, through the driver, agrees to safely bring P to his destination. ([[Lasam vs. Smith, 48 Phil. 657]].)
    >
    > If, throughthe recklessness of the driver, like for example, driving at an unjustified rate of speed or entering a one-way street, an accident occurs, as a result of which P is injured, there is negligence which would make the owner liable for damages. If the taxi contained defective parts, the failure to repair the same constitutes also negligence on the part of the owner. (Ibid.)

- (3) *Delay* (*mora*). — This has already been discussed under [[ARTICLE 1169]].

- (4) *Contravention of the terms of the obligation*. — This is the violation of the terms and conditions stipulated in the obligation without the justifiable excuse or reason. The contravention must not be due to a fortuitous event or *force majeure*. ([[ARTICLE 1174]].)

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > E leased the apartment of R for P10,000 a month to be paid in advance during the first week of ever month. The obligation of E, as lessee, is to pay the stipulated rent. The obligation of R, as lessor, is to maintain E in the peaceful possession of the apartment leased.
    >
    > If E violates his obligation, R is entitled to eject him from the premises and recover damages. If R does not maintain E in the peaceful possession of the apartment (as when R is not the owner), and E is ejected, R may be held liable for damages for violation of the terms of his obligation.
    >
    > The measure of damages to be awarded to E or to R, as the case may be, is left to the sound discretion of the court in accordance with the provision of the Civil Code on Damages. (Title XVIII.)

### Fraud and negligence distinguished
Fraud may be distinguished from negligence as follows:

- (1) In fraud, there is deliberate intention to cause damage or injury, while in negligence, there is no such intention;
- (2) Waiver of the liability for future fraud is void ([[ARTICLE 1171]].), while such waiver may, in a certain sense, be allowed in negligence ([[ARTICLE 1172]].);
- (3) Fraud must be clearly proved, while negligence is presumed from the violation of a contractual obligation; and
- (4) Lastly, liability for fraud cannot be mitigated or reduced by the courts, while liability for negligence may be reduced according to the circumstances. ([[ARTICLE 1173]].)

They are similar in that both are voluntary, that is, they are committed with volition. Where, however, the negligence is gross or there is failure to exercise even slight care or entire absence of care that it shows bad faith or amounts to malice or  wanton attitude on the part of the defendant, the rules on fraud shall apply. In such case, no more distinction exists between the two, at least as to effects. In other words, negligence that is gross or shows bad faith is equivalent to fraud.
