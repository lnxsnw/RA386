### Meaning of fault or negligence. 
*Fault* or *negligence* is defined by the above provision. (par. 1.) According to our Supreme Court, "negligence is the failure to observe for the protection of the interests of another person, that degree of care, precaution and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, whereby such other person suffers injury.” ([[United States vs. Barrias, 23 Phil. 434]].)

### Factors to be considered. 
Negligence is a question of fact, that is, its existence being dependent upon the particular circumstances of each case. There is no hard and fast rule for measuring degree of care. Generally, the degree of care is graduated according to the danger or risk a person or property may be subjected to. 

In determining the issue of negligence, the following factors must be considered: 

- (1) Nature of the obligation. 

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > Smoking while carrying materials known to be inflammable constitutes negligence.

- (2) Circumstances of the person. 

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > A guard, a man in the prime of life, robust and healthy, sleeping while on duty is guilty of negligence.

- (3) Circumstances of time. 

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > Driving a car without headlights at night is gross negligence but it does not by itself constitute negligence when driving during the day. 

- (4) Circumstances of the place. 

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > Driving at 100 kilometers per hour on the superhighway is permissible but driving at the same rate of speed in Ayala Avenue, Makati is gross recklessness. 

### Measure of liability for damages. 
Damages signify the money compensation awarded to a party for loss or injury resulting from breach of contract or obligation by the other. As a rule, the purpose of awarding damages is to place the innocent party in the same (not better) position he would have occupied if the contract or obligation had been performed according to its terms. 

> [!quote] Article 2201 of the Civil Code states: 
> "In contracts and quasi-contracts, the damages for which the obligor who acted in good faith is liable shall be those that are the natural and probable consequences of the breach of the obligation, and which the parties have foreseen or could have reasonably foreseen at the time the obligation was constituted. 
>
> In case of fraud, bad faith, malice or wanton attitude, the obligor shall be responsible for all damages which may be reasonably attributed to the non-performance of the obligation." 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> S agreed to sell and deliver to B on a certain date 1,000 kilos. of sugar of a certain quality for P30,000. Then, B agreed to sell the sugar to be received from S to C for P35,000. This contract with C was made known to S. On the date designated, S did not deliver the sugar, so C bought sugar from another. 
>
> The breach of the obligation by S, resulting in the loss of the amount of P5,000 as expected profit, so angered B that he suffered a heart attack for which he was hospitalized for five (5) days. 
>
> In this case, if S acted in good faith, the damage which B ought to receive should be the amount of P5,000, the profit which B failed to realize. (par. 1, [[ARTICLE 2200]].) 
>
> But, if S acted in bad faith, he is also liable to pay for the hospitalization expenses incurred by B which clearly originated from the breach although they might not have been reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract. (par. 2.) 

### Kinds of diligence required. 
Diligence is the attention and care required of a person in a given situation. Whether or not the negligence of the obligor is excusable will depend on the degree of diligence required of them. 

Under Article 1173, the following kinds of diligence are required: 
- (1) that agreed upon by the parties, orally or in writing; 
- (2) in the absence of stipulation, that required by law in the particular case (like the 	extraordinary diligence required of common carriers); and 
- (3) if both the contract and law are silent, then the diligence expected of a good father of a family. (par. 2; see [[ARTICLE 1163]].)
