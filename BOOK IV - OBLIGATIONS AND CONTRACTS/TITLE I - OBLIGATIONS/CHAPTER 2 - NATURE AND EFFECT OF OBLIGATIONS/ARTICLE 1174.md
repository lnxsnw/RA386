### Meaning of fortuitous event. 
A *fortuitous event* is any event which cannot be foreseen, or which, though foreseen, is inevitable. Stated otherwise, it is an event which is either impossible to foresee or impossible to avoid. 

The essence of a fortuitous event consists of being a happening independent of the will of the debtor and which happening, makes the normal fulfillment of the obligation impossible. 

### Fortuitous event distinguished from force majeure. 
A fortuitous event may either be an act of man or an act of God. 

- (1) *Acts of man*. — Strictly speaking, fortuitous event is an event independent of the will of the obligor but not of other human wills.

  > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
  > War, fire, robbery, murder, insurrection, etc.

- (2) *Acts of God*. — They refer to what is called *majeure* or those events which are totally independent of the will of every human being. 

  > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
  > Earthquake, flood, rain, shipwreck, lightning, eruption of volcano, etc. 

In our law, fortuitous events and *force majeure* are identical insofar as they exempt an obligor from liability. Both are independent of the will of the obligor. 

### Kinds of fortuitous events. 
In speaking of the contract of lease, our Civil Code distinguishes between two (2) kinds of fortuitous events, namely: 

- (1) *Ordinary fortuitous events* or those events which are common and which the contracting 	parties could reasonably foresee (e.g., rain); and 
- (2) *Extra-ordinary fortuitous events* or those events which are uncommon and which the contracting parties could not have reasonably foreseen (e.g., earthquake, fire, war, 	pestilence, unusual flood). (see par. 2, [[ARTICLE 1680]].) 

### Requisites of a fortuitous event. 
They are the following: 

- (1) The event must be independent of the human will or at least of the debtor's will; 
- (2) The event *could not* be foreseen, or if foreseen, is inevitable; 
- (3) The event must be of such a character as to render it impossible for the debtor to comply 	with his obligation in a normal manner; and
- (4) The debtor must be free from any participation in, or the aggravation of, the injury to the creditor, that is, there is no concurrent negligence on his part. 

The absence of *any* of the above requisites (all of which must be proved) would prevent the obligor from being exempt from liability. 

Mere pecuniary inability or poverty is not an excuse for the non-fulfillment of an obligation. Neither is mere *difficulty* to foresee the happening of an event; it is different from the impossibility to foresee the same. As stated earlier, the event must be unforeseeable, or even if it could be foreseen, must be impossible to avoid. 

### Rules as to liability in case of fortuitous event. 
A person is not, as a rule, responsible for loss or damage caused to another resulting from the non-performance of his obligation due to fortuitous events. In other words, his obligation is extinguished. The exceptions are enumerated below. 

- (1) *When expressly specified by law*. — In exceptions (a), (b), and (c) below, the special strictness of the law is justified. 
  - (a) *the debtor is guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay, or contravention of the tenor of the obligation*. (par. 3, [[ARTICLE 1170]], [[ARTICLE 1165]].) 

      > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
      > S is obliged to deliver a specific horse to B on August 10. S did not deliver the horse on said date. If, on August 11, the horse died because it was hit by lightning, S is not liable if no demand was made by B. His obligation is extinguished. 
      >
      > If the horse died after a demand was made by B, S is liable for damages because he is guilty of (legal) delay. In this case, the obligation of S to deliver the horse is also extinguished (see, however, [[ARTICLE 1262]].) but it is converted into monetary obligation to pay damages. (par. 3, [[ARTICLE 1165]].)
      >
      > If the horse would have died in any event even if no demand had been made by B, S would still be liable. A debtor in default becomes liable even for loss due to a fortuitous event. (see [[ARTICLE 1165]].) However, the court may reduce the amount of damages. (see [[ARTICLE 2215]][4].) 

  - (b) *the debtor has promised to deliver the same (specific) thing to two (2) or more persons who do not have the same interest*. (Ibid.)

      > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
      > If S sold and promised to deliver the same car to B and C separately, S is liable even for a fortuitous event. The reason is because it would be impossible for S to comply with his obligation to both B and C even without any fortuitous event taking place. 

  - (c) *the obligation to deliver a specific thing arises from a crime*. ([[ARTICLE 1268]].) 

      > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
      > S stole the carabao of B. S has the obligation, arising from the crime, to return the carabao. Even if the carabao dies or is lost through a fortuitous event, S is still liable for damages unless B is in mora accipiendi. A person is responsible for the results of whatever cause which flow from his criminal act. (see [[U.S. vs. Mambang, 36 Phil. 348]].) 

  - (d) *the thing to be delivered is generic*. ([[ARTICLE 1263]].)

      > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
      > The loss or destruction of a generic thing like rice, corn, sugar, etc. does not produce the extinction of the obligation because the debtor can still comply with his obligation by delivering another thing of the same kind in accordance with the principle that "genus never perishes" (Genus nunquam perit). 

- (2) When declared by stipulation. — The basis for this exception rests upon the freedom of contract. (see [[ARTICLE 1306]].) Such a stipulation is usually intended to better protect the interest of the creditor and procure greater diligence on the part of the debtor in the fulfillment of his obligation. But the intention to make the debtor liable even in case of a fortuitous event should be clearly expressed. 

- (3) When the nature of the obligation requires the assumption of risk. — Here, risk of loss or damage is an essential element in the obligation. 

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > B insured his house against fire for P100,000 with C, an insurance company. Later, the house was destroyed by accidental fire. Although the cause of the loss is a fortuitous event, B may recover the amount of the policy. 
    >
    > In a contract of insurance, the insurer (C), in consideration of the premium paid by the insured (B), undertakes to indemnify the latter for the loss of the thing insured by reason of the peril insured against even if the cause of the loss is a fortuitous event.
