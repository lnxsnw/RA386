# The receipt of the principal by the creditor, without reservation with respect to the interest, shall give rise to the presumption that said interest has been paid. The receipt of a later installment of a debt without reservation as to prior installments, shall likewise raise the presumption that such installments have been paid. (1110a)

> [!summary] States that receiving the principal without any reservation about interest creates a presumption that the interest has been paid. Similarly, receiving a later installment without reservation about previous ones presumes those installments have been paid.

### Meaning of presumption. 
By presumption is meant the inference of a fact not actually known arising from its usual connection with another which is known or proved. 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) X was shot dead. Nobody witnessed the shooting. Y, however, was seen at the scene of the crime just after its commission holding the fatal gun. The fact not actually known is the person who fired the gun. The fact known is the presence of Y at the scene of the crime holding the fatal gun.
>
> The inference is that Y is the person who killed X unless contradicted by competent evidence. 
>
> (2) D borrowed P1,000 from C. Later, D shows a receipt signed by C. The fact not actually known is the payment by D. The fact known is the possession by D of a receipt signed by C. 
>
> The presumption is that the obligation has been paid unless proved otherwise by C as, for example, that D forced C to sign the receipt. 

### Two kinds of presumption. 
They are: 

- (1) Conclusive presumption. - one which cannot be contradicted, like the presumption that everyone is conclusively presumed to know the law (see Art. 3.); and 

- (2) Disputable (or rebuttable) presumption. one which can be contradicted or rebutted by presenting proof to the contrary, like the presumption established in Article 1176. [(see Sec. 69[i], Rule 123, Rules of Court.)](https://www.set.gov.ph/resources/revised-rules-of-court/2000-rules-of-criminal-procedure/)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) Dowes C the amount of P10,000 with interest at 15% a year. C issued a receipt for the principal. The interest was not referred to in the payment whether or not it has been paid. 
>
> It is presumed that the interest has been previously paid by D because normally, the payment of interest precedes that of the principal. (Art. 1253.) This, however, is only a disputable presumption and may be overcome by sufficient evidence that such interest had not really been paid. (par. 1, Art. 1176.) 
>
> (2) E is a lessee in the apartment of R, paying P15,000 rental a month. E failed to pay the rent for the months of February and March. In April, E paid P15,000 and R issued a receipt that the payment is for the month of April. 
>
> The presumption is that the rents for the months of February and March had already been paid. This is also in accordance with the usual business practice whereby prior installments are first liquidated before payments are applied to the later installments. Again, this presumption is merely disputable. (par. 2, Art. 1176,; see [[Rubert and Guamis vs. Smith, 11 Phil. 138]]; [[Manila Trading & Supply Co. vs. Medina, 2 SCRA 549]].) 

### When presumptions in Article 1176 do not apply. 

- (1) With reservation as the interest. —  The presumption established in Article 1176 do not arise where there is a reservation that no payment has been made as to interest or prior installments, as the case may be. The reservation may be made in writing or verbally. Thus, in the preceding examples, no presumption of payment arises where there is a reservation by C or R that no payment has been made as to the interest or the rents for February and March, as the case may be. 

- (2) Receipt without indication of particular installment paid. — The presumption in paragraph 2 of Article 1176 is not applicable if the receipt does not recite that it was issued for a particular installment due as when the receipt is only dated. Thus, in the preceding example (No. 2.), the fact alone that the receipt issued by R is dated April 5 does not justify the inference that the rents for February and March had been paid. 

- (3) Receipt for a part of the principal. — Such a receipt, without mentioning the interest, implies that the creditor waives his right to apply the payment first to the interest and then to the principal as permitted by [[ARTICLE 1253]]. (infra.) It is only when the principal is fully receipted for and there is failure by the creditor to reserve the claim for interest, that the presumption that the said interest has been paid will arise. 

- (4) Payment of taxes. — Article 1176 does not apply to payment of taxes. There is no presumption that previous taxes have been paid by the payment of later ones. 

- (5) Non-payment proven. — Of course, Article 1176 is not applicable where the non-payment of prior obligations has been proven. A presumption cannot prevail over a proven fact.
