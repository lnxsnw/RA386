### Transmissibility of rights. 

All rights acquired in virtue of an obligation are generally transmissible or assignable. (see [[ARTICLE 1311]].) The exceptions to this rule are the following: 

- (1) Prohibited by law. – When prohibited by law like the rights in partnership, agency, and commodatum which are purely personal in character. 
    - (a) By the contract of partnership, two or more persons bind themselves to contribute money, property or industry to a common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves. ([[ARTICLE 1767]].) 
    - (b) By the contract of agency, a person binds himself to render some service or to do something in representation or on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the latter. ([[ARTICLE 1868]].)
    - (c) By the contract of commodatum, one of the parties delivers to another something not consumable (e.g., car) so that the latter may use the same for a certain time and return it. Commodatum is essentially gratuitous. ([[ARTICLE 1933]].) 
 
- (2) Prohibited by stipulation of the parties. - When prohibited by stipulation of the parties, like the stipulation that upon the death of the creditor, the obligation shall be extinguished, or that the creditor cannot assign his credit to another. 

Such stipulation, being contrary to the general rule, must be clearly proved, or, at the very least, clearly implied from the wordings or terms of the contract itself.
