### Situations contemplated in Article 1167.
Article 1167 refers to an obligation to do, i.e., to perform an act or render a service. It contemplates three (3) situations:

- (1) The debtor fails to perform an obligation to do;
- (2) The debtor performs an obligation to do but contrary to the terms thereof; or
- (3) The debtor performs an obligation to do but in poor manner.

### Remedies of creditor in positive personal obligation.
- (1) If the debtor fails to comply with his obligation to do, the creditor has the right:
    - (a) to have the obligation performed by himself, or by another, unless personal considerations are involved, at the debtor’s expense; and
    - (b) to recover damages. ([[ARTICLE 1170]].)
- (2) In case the obligation is done in contravention of the terms of the same or is poorly done, it may be ordered (by the court upon complaint) that it be undone if it is still possible to undo what was done.

### Performance by a third person.

(1) *Compelling performance by debtor prohibited*. — A personal obligation to do, like a real obligation to deliver a generic thing, can be performed by a third person. While the debtor can be compelled to make the delivery of a specific thing ([[ARTICLE 1165]].), a specific performance cannot be ordered in a personal obligation to do because this may amount to involuntary servitude which, as a rule, is prohibited under our Constitution. ([Art. II, Sec. 18[2]](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/) thereof.)

(2) *Indemnification of creditor for damages*. — Where, however, the personal qualifications of the debtor are the determining motive for the obligation contracted (e.g., to sing in a night club), the performance of the same by another would be impossible or would result to be so different that the obligation could not be considered performed. Hence, the only feasible remedy of the creditor is indemnification for damages. But where the obligation can still be performed at the expense of the debtor notwithstanding his failure or refusal to do so, the court is not authorized to merely grant damages to the creditor.


> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) X binds himself to construct a house for B. Among other things, it was stipulated that the house shall have 3 bedrooms, each of which to have an area of 5 meters by 4 meters and that the kitchen shall be painted all white.
>
> If X does not construct the house, B may ask C to contract the house at the expense of X.
>
> (2) Suppose X constructed the house but the size of the bedroom is not 5 meters by 4 meters or the kitchen is not painted all white.
>
> In this case, B can ask X to have it done according to the specifications. If X refuses, the obligation may be performed by C at the expense of X. In case there is a litigation, the court will order X to pay B the amount paid by B to C and not merely grant damages to B.
>
> (3) Now, if the kitchen was painted white but the painting was poorly done, B may ask X that it be undone or, in case of X's refusal, he may ask C to paint the kitchen at the expense of X.
>
> In no case, however, can X be compelled against his will to comply with his obligation should he refuse to do so.
>
> (4) If the obligation contracted by X is to sing in the night club of B and he fails to comply with his obligation, the performance of the same by another would be impossible or would result to be so different that the obligation could not be considered performed.
> 
> Here, the personal qualification of X is the determining motive for the contract. In this case, the only practical remedy of B is indemnification for damages.
