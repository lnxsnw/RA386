### Constructive fulfillment of suspensive condition.
There are three (3) requisites for the application of this article:
- (1) The condition is suspensive;
- (2) The obligor actually prevents the fulfillment of the condition; and
- (3) He acts voluntarily.

The law does not require that the obligor acts with malice or fraud as long as his purpose is to prevent the fulfillment of the condition. He should not be allowed to profit from his own fault or bad faith to the prejudice of the obligee.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) X agreed to give Y a 5% commission if the latter could sell the former’s land at a certain price. Y found a buyer who definitely decided to buy the property upon the terms prescribed by X. To evade the payment of the commission agreed upon, X himself sold to the buyer the property at a lower price without the aid of Y.
> 
> > In this case, it can be said that the due performance by Y of his undertaking, the condition for the payment of the commission, was purposely prevented by X, and is deemed fulfilled.
>
> - (2) S promised to sell his land to Y if Y would be able to secure a loan from a certain bank. Later on, S changed his mind about selling his land. He induced the bank not to give Y a loan.
> 
> > Under the above article, the condition is deemed complied with and S is liable to sell his land. S should not be allowed to profit by his own fault or bad faith.
>
> - (3) Suppose the inducement made by S was prompted by some other reason, is there constructive fulfillment? Yes. The law does not require that S act with malice or fraud as long as his purpose is to prevent the fulfillment of the condition.
> 
> > Article 1186, however, does not apply if the act of the obligor is in the exercise of a right.

### Constructive fulfillment of resolutory condition.
Article 1186 applies also to an obligation subject to a resolutory condition with respect to the debtor who is bound to return what he has received upon the fulfillment of the condition. ([[ARTICLE 1190]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X obliges himself to allow Y to occupy the former’s house in Manila as long as X is assigned by their company in the province. When Y learned that X would be transferred to Manila, he was able to induce the president of the company to assign another person in place of X.
> The obligation of X is extinguished because the fulfillment of the resolutory condition was voluntarily prevented by Y. Hence, Y must vacate the house. (see [[ARTICLE 1190]].)
