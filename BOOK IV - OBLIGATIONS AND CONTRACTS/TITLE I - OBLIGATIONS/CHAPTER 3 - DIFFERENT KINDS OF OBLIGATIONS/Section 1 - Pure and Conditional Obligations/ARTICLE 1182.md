### Classification of conditions.
Conditions may be classified as follows:
- **(1) As to effect:**
    - (a) *Suspensive.* — the happening of which gives rise to the obligation; and
    - (b) *Resolutory.* — the happening of which extinguishes the obligation.
- **(2) As to form:**
    - (a) *Express.* — the condition is clearly stated; and
    - (b) *Implied.* — the condition is merely inferred.
- **(3) As to possibility:**
    - (a) *Possible.* — the condition is capable of fulfillment, legally and physically; and
    - (b) *Impossible.* — the condition is not capable of fulfillment, legally or physically.
- **(4) As to cause or origin:**
    - (a) *Potestative.* — the condition depends upon the will of one of the contracting parties;
    - (b) *Casual.* — the condition depends upon chance or upon the will of a third person; and
    - (c) *Mixed.* — the condition depends partly upon chance and partly upon the will of a third person.
- **(5) As to mode:**
    - (a) *Positive.* — the condition consists in the performance of an act; and
    - (b) *Negative.* — the condition consists in the omission of an act.
- **(6) As to number:**
    - (a) *Conjunctive.* — there are several conditions and all must be fulfilled; and
    - (b) *Disjunctive.* — there are several conditions and only one or some of them must be fulfilled.
- **(7) As to divisibility:**
    - (a) *Divisible.* — the condition is susceptible of partial performance; and
    - (b) *Indivisible.* — the condition is not susceptible of partial performance.

### Potestative condition.
A condition suspensive in nature and which depends upon the sole will of one of the contracting parties is known as *potestative condition*.

### Where suspensive condition depends upon will of debtor.
- *(1) Conditional obligation void.* — Where the potestative condition depends solely upon the will of the debtor, the conditional obligation shall be void because its validity and compliance is left to the will of the debtor ([[ARTICLE 1308]].) and it cannot, therefore, be easily demanded. In order not to be liable, the debtor will just not fulfill the condition. There is no burden on the debtor and consequently, no juridical tie is created. ([[ARTICLE 1156]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) “I will pay you if I want.”
> - (2) “I will pay you after I receive a loan from a bank.” (Berg vs. Magdalena Estate, Inc., 92 Phil. 110.)
> - (3) “I will pay you after I recover what X owes.”
> - (4) “I will pay you after I have harvested fish.” (Trillana vs. Quezon College, Inc., 93 Phil. 383.)
> - (5) “I will pay you upon the sale of the house in which I live.” (Osmeña vs. Rama, 14 Phil. 99.)
> - (6) “I will pay you the price of the forest concession you sold me upon my operation of the same.” (Tible vs. Aquino, 65 SCRA 207.)
> - (7) “I will continue to lease your property for as long as I need the premises and pay the rent.”
> > In all the above cases, both the conditions and the obligations are void. The conditions in examples Nos. 2 to 6 are tantamount to a debtor telling the creditor that he would pay his obligation when and if he wants. In example No. 7, the continuance, effectivity and fulfillment of the lease contract depends solely upon the uncontrolled will of the lessee.

- (2) Only the condition void. — If the obligation is a pre-existing one and, therefore, does not depend for its existence upon the fulfillment by the debtor of the potestative condition, only the condition is void leaving unaffected the obligation itself. Here, the condition is imposed not on the birth of the obligation but on its fulfillment.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> D borrowed P10,000 from C payable within two months. Subsequently, D promised to pay C “after D sells his car” to which C agreed. In this case, only the condition is void but not the pre-existing obligation of D to pay C.


### Where suspensive condition depends upon will of creditor.
If the condition depends exclusively upon the will of the creditor, the obligation is valid.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> “I will pay you my indebtedness upon your demand.”
> The obligation does not become illusory. Normally, the creditor is interested in the fulfillment of the obligation because it is for his benefit. It is up to him whether to enforce his right or not.

### Where resolutory condition depends upon will of debtor.
If the condition is resolutory in nature, like the right to repurchase in a sale with *pacto de retro*, the obligation is valid although its fulfillment depends upon the sole will of the debtor (seller). The fulfillment of the condition merely causes the extinguishment or loss of rights already acquired. ([[ARTICLE 1181]].) The debtor is naturally interested in its fulfillment.

The position of the debtor when the condition is resolutory is exactly the same as that of the creditor when the condition is suspensive.

### Casual condition.
If the suspensive condition depends upon chance or upon the will of a third person, the obligation subject to it is valid.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) Where X, building contractor, obliges himself in favor of Y, owner, to repair at X’s expense any damage that may be caused to the building by any earthquake occurring within 10 years from the date of the completion of its construction.
> - (2) Where S binds himself to sell his land to B if he wins a case which is pending before the Supreme Court.

### Mixed condition.
The obligation is valid if the suspensive condition depends partly upon chance and partly upon the will of a third person.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> Where X, building contractor, obliges himself in favor of Y, owner, to repair at X’s expense, any damage to the building taking place after an earthquake if found by a panel of arbitrators that construction defects contributed in any way to the damage.
> Both conditions must take place in order that X’s obligation will arise. The decision of the panel (third party) must be accepted by X and Y as final unless it can be shown that it was incompetent to act in that capacity or was obviously biased favoring X or Y.

### Where suspensive condition depends partly upon will of debtor.
According to Manresa, the use of the word “exclusive” (now “sole”) makes it clear that conditional obligations whose fulfillment depends *partly upon the will of the debtor and partly upon the will of a third person*, or upon chance are perfectly valid. (Jacinto vs. Chua Leng, [C.A.], 45 O.G. 2919, citing 4 Manresa 126.)

It is believed, however, that if the compliance with the obligation still depends upon that part of the condition whose fulfillment depends upon the will of the debtor, the obligation is void as it is within his power to comply or not to comply with the same. The situation is the same as if the condition depends entirely upon the will of the debtor.
