### Positive condition.
The above article refers to positive (suspensive) condition â€” the happening of an event at a determinate time. The obligation is extinguished:
- (1) as soon as the time expires *without the event taking place*; or
- (2) as soon as it has become indubitable that the event will not take place *although the time specified has not expired*.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X obliges himself to give B P10,000 if B will marry C before B reaches the age of 23.
> - (a) X is liable if B marries C before he reaches the age of 23.
> - (b) X is not liable if B marries C at the age of 23 or after he reaches the age of 23. In this case, the time specified, before reaching the age of 23, has expired without the condition (marrying C) being fulfilled. The obligation is extinguished as soon as B becomes 23 years old.
> - (c) If B dies at the age of 22 without having married C, the obligation is extinguished because it has become indubitable that the condition will not take place. In this case, the obligation of X is deemed extinguished from the death of B, although the time specified (before reaching the age of 23) has not yet expired.
