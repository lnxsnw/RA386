# The effects of a conditional obligation to give, once the condition has been fulfilled, shall retroact to the day of the constitution of the obligation. Nevertheless, when the obligation imposes reciprocal prestations upon the parties, the fruits and interests during the pendency of the condition shall be deemed to have been mutually compensated. If the obligation is unilateral, the debtor shall appropriate the fruits and interests received, unless from the nature and circumstances of the obligation it should be inferred that the intention of the person constituting the same was different. In obligations to do and not to do, the courts shall determine, in each case, the retroactive effect of the condition that has been complied with. (1120)

> [!summary] Once the condition of a conditional obligation is fulfilled, its effects retroact to the day the obligation was created. For reciprocal obligations, the fruits and interests are mutually compensated during the pendency. In unilateral obligations, the debtor keeps the fruits and interests unless inferred otherwise. In obligations to do or not to do, courts determine the retroactive effect.

### Retroactive effects of fulfillment of suspensive condition.
- (1) *In obligations to give.* — An obligation to give subject to a suspensive condition becomes demandable only upon the fulfillment of the condition. However, once the condition is fulfilled, its effects shall retroact to the day when the obligation was constituted. (par. 1; see Enriquez vs. Ramos, 73 SCRA 116.)

> The reason is because the condition is only an accidental element of a contract. (see [[ARTICLE 1318]].) An obligation can exist without being subject to a condition. Had the parties known beforehand that the condition would be fulfilled they would have bound themselves under a pure obligation. Hence, the obligation should be considered from the time it is constituted and not from the time the condition is fulfilled.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> On January 20, S agreed to sell his parcel of land to B for P50,000 should B lose a case involving the recovery of another parcel of land. On April 10, S sold his land to C. B lost the case on December 4.
> Before December 4, B had no right to demand the sale of the land by S. When the condition, however, was fulfilled on December 4, it is as if B was entitled to the land beginning January 20. Hence, as between B and C, B will have a better right over the land. (It is required, however, under the Property Registration Decree [Pres. Decree No. 1529, Sec. 51.] that the promise of S be annotated on the back of the certificate of title of the property to be binding against a third person like C.)
> If the land was sold by B to D on May 15, D would still have a better right as against C since the sale by B will be considered valid.

- (2) *In obligations to do or not to do.* — With respect to the retroactive effect of the fulfillment of a suspensive condition, in obligations to do or not to do, no fixed rule is provided.

> The courts are empowered by the use of sound discretion and bearing in mind the intent of the parties, to determine, in each case, the retroactive effect of the suspensive condition that has been complied with. (par. 2.) It includes the power to decide that the fulfillment of the condition shall have no retroactive effect or from what date such retroactive effect shall take effect.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) C obliged himself to condone the debt of D, his lawyer, should the latter win C’s case in the Supreme Court.
> 
> > In this case, upon the fulfillment of the condition, C shall not be entitled, unless the contrary has been stipulated, to the earned interests of the capital during the pendency of the condition as the intention of C is to extinguish the debt. Here, the fulfillment of the condition has a retroactive effect.
> - (2) Suppose, in the preceding example, the obligation contracted by C was to construct *gratis* the house of D upon the fulfillment of the condition.
> 
> > In this case, unless the contrary clearly appears, there is no retroactive effect if the condition is fulfilled, taking into consideration the nature of the obligation and the intent of the parties. Therefore, C is not liable to pay interest on the money value of the obligation for the intervening period.

### Retroactive effects as to fruits and interests in obligations to give.
- (1) *In reciprocal obligations.* — There is no retroactivity because the fruits and interests received during the pendency of the condition are deemed to have been mutually compensated. This rule is necessary for purposes of convenience since the parties do not have to render mutual accounting of what they have received. Fruits here may be natural, industrial, or civil fruits. (see [[ARTICLE 1164]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> In the first example under the preceding topic, when B lost the case in court on December 4, S must deliver the land and B must pay P50,000.
> S does not have to give the fruits received from the land before December 4 and B is not obliged to pay legal interests on the price since the fruits and interests received are deemed to have been mutually compensated.

- (2) *In unilateral obligations.* — There is usually no retroactive effect because they are gratuitous. The debtor receives nothing from the creditor. Thus, fruits and interests belong to the debtor unless from the nature and other circumstances of the obligation it should be inferred that the intention of the person constituting the same was different.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> Suppose, in the same example, the promise of S was to donate the parcel of land to B.
> Upon the fulfillment of the condition, S has to deliver the land but he has the right to keep to himself all the fruits and interests he may have received during the pendency of the condition, that is, from January 20 to December 4, unless a contrary intention by S may be inferred, as when it is stipulated that once the condition is fulfilled, S shall render an accounting of fruits received during its pendency.
