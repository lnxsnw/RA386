# The condition that some event will not happen at a determinate time shall render the obligation effective from the moment the time indicated has elapsed, or if it has become evident that the event cannot occur. If  no time has been fixed, the condition shall be deemed fulfilled at such time as may have probably been contemplated, bearing in mind the nature of the obligation. (1118)

> [!summary] If an obligation depends on an event not happening within a specified time, the obligation becomes effective once the time has passed or if it becomes clear that the event cannot occur.

### Negative condition.
The above provision speaks of a negative condition — that an event will not happen at a determinate time. (see [[ARTICLE 879]].) The obligation shall become effective and binding:
- (1) from the moment the time indicated has elapsed *without the event taking place*; or
- (2) from the moment it has become evident that the event cannot occur, *although the time indicated has not yet elapsed*.

If no time is fixed, the circumstances shall be considered to arrive at the intention of the parties. This rule may also be applied to a positive condition.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X binds himself to give B P10,000 if B is not yet married to C on December 30.
> - (a) X is not liable to B if B marries C on December 30 or prior thereto.
> - (b) X is liable to B if on December 30, B is not married to C and if B marries C after December 30. In the latter case, the condition (not marrying C) is fulfilled upon the expiration of the time indicated, which is December 30.
> - (c) Suppose C dies on November 20 without having been married to B. The obligation is rendered effective because it is certain that the condition not to marry C will be fulfilled. In this case, the obligation becomes effective from the moment of C’s death on November 20 although the time indicated (December 30) has not yet elapsed.
