### Where both parties are guilty of breach. 
The above article contemplates two (2) situations:
- (1)* First infractor known.* — One party violated his obligation; subsequently, the other also violated his part of the obligation. In this case, the liability of the first infractor should be equitably reduced.
- (2) *First infractor cannot be determined.* — One party violated his obligation followed by the other, but it cannot be determined which of them was the first infractor. The rule is that the contract shall be deemed extinguished and each shall bear his own damages.
    > In effect, the court shall not provide remedy to either of the parties, who must suffer the damages allegedly sustained by them.
    
    > “The above rules are deemed just. The first one is fair to both parties because the second infractor also derived, or thought he would derive, some advantage by his own act or neglect. The second rule is likewise just because it is presumed that both at about the same time tried to reap some benefit.” (Report of the Code Commission, p. 130.)

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > S sold his television set to B. The agreement is that the set shall be delivered on October 1 at the house of B and payment shall be made by B upon delivery. S did not deliver the set on October 1 in spite of a demand made by B. Five (5) days later, S delivered the set but B incurred in delay in paying the purchase price.
    >
    > In a suit between S and B, the liability of S for damages should be equitably tempered by the court, taking into consideration the breach also of the obligation on the part of B.
    >
    > If both alleged that the other was the first infractor and the court cannot determine who of the two is telling the truth, the contract shall be deemed extinguished and each shall bear his own damages. This means that the contract shall not be enforced.
