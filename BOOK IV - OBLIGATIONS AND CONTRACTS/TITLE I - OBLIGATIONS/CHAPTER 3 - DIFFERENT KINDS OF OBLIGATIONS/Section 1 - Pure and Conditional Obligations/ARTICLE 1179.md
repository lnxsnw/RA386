# Every obligation whose performance does not depend upon a future or uncertain event, or upon a past event unknown to the parties, is demandable at once.

> [!summary] States that any obligation which does not depend on a future, uncertain event, or an unknown past event is immediately demandable.

> [!example]- Case Examples
> Demandable obligation
> ```
> A agrees to pay B P10,000. Since no condition is tied to the payment, B can demand the amount immediately.
> ```
> Obligation contingent on an uncertain event
> ```
> C will pay Y P50,000 only if D wins a race. Since the payment depends on a future uncertain event, the obligation is not demandable until the race is won.

### Meaning of pure obligation.
A *pure obligation* is one which is not subject to any condition and no specific date mentioned for its fulfillment and is therefore, immediately demandable.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> (1) D obliges himself to pay C P1,000. The obligation is immediately demandable because there is no condition and no date is mentioned for its fulfillment.
> 
> Of course, if the loan has just been contracted by D, a period must have been intended by the parties for performance but the duration thereof will depend upon the nature of the obligation and the circumstances. ([[ARTICLE 1197]].)
> (2) D binds himself to pay C P1,000 "upon demand of C." The obligation is immediately due and demandable.

### Meaning of conditional obligation.
A *conditional obligation* is one whose consequences are in one way or another to the fullfillment of a condition.

### Meaning of condition.
*Condition* is a future and uncertain event, upon the happening of which, the acquisition or extinguishment of an obligation (or right) subject to it depends.

### Characteristics of a condition.
- (1) *Future and uncertain*. - In order to constitute an event as a condition, it is not enough that it be future; it must also be uncertain. The first paragraph of Article 1179 obviously uses the disjunctive "or" between "future" and "uncertain" to distinguish pure obligation from both the conditional obligation and one with a period. Be that as it may, the word "or" should be "and."
- (2) *Past but unknown*. - A condition may refer to a past event unknown to the parties. (infra.) If it refers to a future event, both its very occurrence and the time of such occurence must be uncertain; otherwise, it is not a condition.
> A condition must not be impossible. (see [[ARTICLE 1183.]])

### Two principal kinds of obligation.
They are:

- (1) *Suspensive condition* (*condition precedent* or *condition antecedent*) or one the fulfillment of which *will give rise* to an obligation (or right). In other words, the demandability of the obligation is suspended until the happening of the uncertain event which constitutes the condition. 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> I will sell you the land if it is adjudicated to me in the division of my deceased father's estate. My obligation is demandable only after the condition is fulfilled — my becoming the owner of the land. In the meantime, I am not liable to you.

- (2) *Resolutory condition* (*condition subsequent*) or one the fulfillment of which *will extinguish* an obligation (or right) already existing.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> D, in payment of his debt to C, binds himself to give C P3,000 monthly allowance until C graduates from college.
> D's obligation is demandable now but it shall be extinguished or terminated upon the happening of the resolutory condition — C's graduating from college.

### Distinctions between suspensive and resolutory conditions.
The difference between the two (2) conditions is very clear: both bear an influence on the existence of the obligation, but in diametrically opposed manner.
- (1) If the suspensive condition is fulfilled, the obligation arises, while if it is the resolutory condition that is fulfilled, the obligation is extinguished;
- (2) If the first does not take place, the tie of law (juridical or legal tie) does not appear, while if it is the other, the tie of law is consolidated; and
- (3) Until the first takes place, the existence of the obligation is a mere hope, while in the second, its effects flow, but over it hovers the possibility of termination. (see 8 Manresa 130-131.)

### When obligation is demandable at once.
An obligation is demandable at once
- (1) when it is pure (par. 1, Art. 1179.);
- (2) when it is subject to a resolutory condition (Ibid., par. 2.); or
- (3) when it is subject to a resolutory period. (par. 2, [[ARTICLE 1193]].)

### Past event unknown to the parties.
A condition really refers only to an uncertain *and* future event. A past event cannot be said to be a condition since the demandability of an obligation subject to a condition depends upon whether the event will happen or will not happen.

What is really contemplated by the law is the knowledge to be acquired in the future of a past event which at the moment is unknown to the parties interested, for it is only in that sense that the event can be deemed uncertain. This knowledge determines whether the obligation will arise or not. (see 8 Manresa 120-121.)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X is the owner of a parcel of land which is being claimed by Y. Last week, the Supreme Court has rendered a final decision upholding the right of X. However, X has not yet received the notice that he had won the case. Now, X obliged himself to sell his land to B, should he win the case against Y.
> 
> Under the facts, X would be bound to sell the land to B upon receipt of the notice that he had won the case against Y.
