## Book Contents

### Where duration of period depends upon the will of debtor.
A period is a future and certain event upon the arrival of which the obligation subject to it either arises or is extinguished. 

- (1) *The debtor promises to pay when his means permit him to do so*. — The obligation shall be deemed to be one with a period. In this case, what depends upon the debtor’s will is not whether he should pay or not for indeed he binds himself to pay. What is left only to his will is the duration of the period.
	> If the debtor and the creditor cannot agree as to the specific time for payment, the court shall fix the same on the application of either party. ([[ARTICLE 1197]], par. 2.)
- (2) *Other cases.* — As when the debtor binds himself to pay:
	- (a) "little by little" (Scone vs. Francisco, 24 Phil. 309.);
	- (b) "as soon as possible" (Gonzales vs. Jose, 66 Phil. 369.);
	- (c) "from time to time";
	- (d) "at any time I have the money" (Soriano vs. Abalos, 84 Phil. 206.);
	- (e) "in partial payments" (Levy Hermanos vs. Paterno, 18 Phil. 353.); and
	- (f) "when I am in a position to pay." (see Luding Hahn vs. Lazatin, [unrep.] 105 Phil. 1358.)
> Obligations with a period are discussed in the next sections. (Arts. 1193-1198.)
