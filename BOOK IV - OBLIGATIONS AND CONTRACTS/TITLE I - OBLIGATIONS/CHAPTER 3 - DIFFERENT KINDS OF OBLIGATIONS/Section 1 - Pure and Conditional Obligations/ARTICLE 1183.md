# Impossible conditions, those contrary to good customs or public policy and those prohibited by law shall annul the obligation which depends upon them. If the obligation is divisible, that part thereof which is not affected by the impossible or unlawful condition shall be valid. The condition not to do an impossible thing shall be considered as not having been agreed upon. (1116a)

> [!summary] States that obligations dependent on impossible conditions, those against good customs, public policy, or prohibited by law, are void. If the obligation is divisible, the valid part remains unaffected.

### When Article 1183 applies.
Article 1183 refers to suspensive conditions. It applies only to cases where the impossibility already existed at the time the obligation was constituted. If the impossibility arises after the creation of the obligation, [[ARTICLE 1266]] governs.

### Two kinds of impossible conditions.
They are:
- (1) *Physically impossible conditions.* — when they, in nature of things, cannot exist or cannot be done.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) “I will pay you P10,000 if it will not rain for one year in the Philippines.”
> (2) “I will pay you P10,000 if you can carry twenty (20) cavans of palay on your shoulder.”

- (2) *Legally impossible conditions.* — when they are contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> X will give Y P1,000 if Y — 
> - (1) will kill Z (against the law); or
> - (2) will be the common-law wife of X (against morals); or
> - (3) will slap his father (against good customs); or
> - (4) will publicly advocate the overthrow of the government (against public order); or
> - (5) will not appear as a witness against X in a criminal case (against public policy).

### Effect of impossible conditions.
- (1) *Conditional obligation void.* — Impossible conditions annul the obligation which depends upon them. Both the obligation and the condition are void. The reason behind the law is that the obligor knows his obligation cannot be fulfilled. He has no intention to comply with his obligation.
- *(2) Conditional obligation valid.* — If the condition is negative, that is, not to do an impossible thing, it is disregarded and the obligation is rendered pure and valid. (par. 2.) Actually, the condition is always fulfilled when it is not to do an impossible thing so that it is the same as if there were no condition.

> The negative condition may not be to give an impossible thing.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) “I will sell you my land if you do not carry 20 cavans of palay on your shoulder.”
> (2) “I will sell you my land if you do not give me a dog that talks.”
> 
> The obligations are pure and, therefore, demandable at once.

- (3) *Only the affected obligation void.* — If the obligation is divisible, the part thereof not affected by the impossible condition shall be valid.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> “I will give you P10,000 if you sell my land, and a car, if you kill Pedro.”
> The obligation to give P10,000 is valid but the obligation to give a car is void because it is dependent upon an impossible condition.

- (4) *Only the condition void.* — If the obligation is a pre-existing obligation, and, therefore, does not depend upon the fulfillment of the condition which is impossible, for its existence, only the condition is void.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> D borrowed P10,000 from C. If C later agreed to kill X before D pays him, the condition “to kill X” is void but not the pre-existing obligation of D “to pay C.”
