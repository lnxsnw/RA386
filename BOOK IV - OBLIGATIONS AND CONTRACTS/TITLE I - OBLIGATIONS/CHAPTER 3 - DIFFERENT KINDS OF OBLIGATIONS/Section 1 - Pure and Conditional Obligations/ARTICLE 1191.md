# The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him. The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible. The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period. This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with articles 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law. (1124)

> [!summary] In reciprocal obligations, if one party fails to fulfill their duties, the injured party can choose between enforcing the obligation or rescinding it, with the option of seeking damages in either case. Rescission can be sought even after choosing fulfillment if the latter becomes impossible. The court will decree rescission unless a just cause for setting a period is provided. Rights of third parties acquiring the thing are preserved.

### Kinds of obligation according to the person obliged.
They are:
- (1) *Unilateral.* — when only one party is obliged to comply with a prestation. 
    
    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
    > Donation; In a contract of *loan*, the lender has the obligation to give. After the lender has complied with his obligation, the debtor has the obligation to pay.

- (2) *Bilateral.* — when both parties are mutually bound to each other. In other words, both parties are debtors and creditors of each other. Bilateral obligations may be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. 
    - (a) *Reciprocal obligations* are those which arise from the same cause and in which each party is a debtor and creditor of the other, such that the performance of one is designed to be the equivalent and the condition for the performance of the other of his own obligation.
    
        Each party may treat the fulfillment of what is incumbent upon the other as a *suspensive condition* to his obligation (see Art. 1169, last par.) and its non-fulfillment, as a tacit or implied *resolutory condition*, giving him the right to demand the rescission of the contract.

        > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
        > In a contract of sale, in the absence of any stipulation, the delivery of the thing sold by the seller is conditioned upon the simultaneous payment of the purchase price by the buyer, and vice-versa. 
        >
        > The seller is the creditor as to the price and debtor as to the thing, while the buyer is the creditor as to the thing and debtor as to the price.

    - (b) *Non-reciprocal obligations* are those which do not impose simultaneous and correlative performance on both parties. In other words, the performance of one party is not dependent upon the simultaneous performance by the other of his own obligation.

        > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
        > X borrowed from Y P5,000. Y, on the other hand, borrowed X’s car. The performance by X of his obligation to Y is not conditioned upon the performance by Y of his obligation and vice-versa. 
        >
        > Although X and Y are debtors and creditors of each other, their obligations are not reciprocal. The obligation of X arises from the contract of *loan*, while that of Y, from the contract of *commodatum*. The obligations are not dependent upon each other and are not simultaneous. Article 1191 applies only if the reciprocity arises from the same cause.

### Remedies in reciprocal obligations.
- (1) *Choice of remedies.* — In case one of the obligors does not comply with what is incumbent upon him, the aggrieved party may choose between two (2) remedies:
    - (a) action for *specific performance* (fulfillment) of the obligation with damages; or
    - (b) action for *rescission* of the obligation also with damages.

    *Rescission* is the remedy available to an obligee when the obligor fails to comply with his obligation, to abrogate their contract as if it was never entered into, with the right to recover damages.

- (2) *Remedy of rescission for non-compliance.* — The principal action for rescission for non-performance under Article 1191 must be distinguished from the subsidiary action for rescission by reason of lesion or damage under Article 1381, et seq., and from cancellation of a contract based, for example, on defect in the consent (see Arts. 1318, 1330.) and not on violation by a party of his obligation.

    Article 1191 governs where there is non-compliance by one of the contracting parties in case of reciprocal obligations. The remedy is granted for breach by the other contracting party that violates the reciprocity between them.

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > In contract of *sale* of a car between S and B, it was agreed that S, the owner, would deliver the car and the necessary documents duly signed by him to B at the house of C on December 1, and B would deliver the payment at the same place and on the same date.
    > 
    > If S does not comply with his obligation:
    > - (a) B may, in an action for specific performance, demand the delivery of the car with damages; or
    > - (b) B may demand from the court the rescission of the contract also with damages. 
    >
    > When a party demands rescission in reciprocal obligations he, in effect, treats the non-fulfillment by the other party of his obligation as a *resolutory condition*. 

### Court may grant guilty party term for performance.
The court shall order the rescission claimed unless there should be *just cause* for granting the party in default a term or period for the performance of his obligation. (par. 3.)

Obviously, this exception applies only where the guilty party is willing to comply with his obligation but needs time to do so and not where he refuses to perform.

### Remedies are alternative.
The remedies of the injured or aggrieved party are *alternative* and not *cumulative,* that is, he is privileged to choose only one of the remedies, and not both, subject only to the exception in paragraph 2, to wit: he may also seek rescission even after he has chosen fulfillment if the latter should become impossible. But after choosing rescission of the obligation, he cannot thereafter demand its compliance.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> In the preceding example, B may not choose both fulfillment and rescission. If he has chosen rescission, he may not subsequently ask for fulfillment and if he has selected to enforce compliance with the contract, he may not later seek rescission.
> However, if fulfillment becomes impossible because the car was lost or destroyed through the fault of S, B is allowed to convert his action into that of rescission.

### Limitations on right to demand rescission.
The right to rescind by the injured party (the one who has performed what is incumbent upon him) is not absolute. Thus —
- (1) *Resort to the courts.* — The rescission contemplated by Article 1191 is a *judicial rescission* (par. 3.) or one granted by a court. The injured party has to resort to the courts to assert his rights judicially (e.g., to recover what he has delivered under the contract) for the same article provides that… “the court shall decree the rescission claimed, *unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.*” 
    > No person can take justice or the law in his own hands and decide by himself what are his rights in the matter. The other party must be given an opportunity to be heard.
- (2) *Power of court to fix period.* — The court has discretionary power to allow a period within which a person in default may be permitted to perform his obligation *if there is a just cause for giving time to the debtor* (par. 3.), as where the default incurred was not willful or could be excused in view of the surrounding circumstances.
- (3) *Right of third person.* — If the thing subject matter of the obligation is in the hands of a third person who acted in good faith, rescission is not available as a remedy. (par. 4, Arts. 1385, 1388.)
- (4) *Substantial violation.* — The general rule is that *rescission will not be granted for slight breaches of contract;* the violation should be substantial as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement. Thus, in a case, it was held that *delays on four (4) occasions in the payment of rentals for a few days were not substantial violations in a contract of lease to justify rescission* because the law is not concerned with trifles. (Fil Oil Refinery Corp. vs. Mendoza, 150 SCRA 632 [1987].)
- (5) *Waiver of right.* — The right to rescind may be waived, expressly or impliedly. Thus, the *acceptance by the seller of the land sold as security for the balance of the price is an implied waiver* of the right to rescind in case of nonpayment by the buyer. His remedy is to recover the balance. (Roman vs. Blas, [C.A.] 51 O.G. 1920, April 1955.)

### Rescission without previous judicial decree. 
- (1) *Where automatic rescission expressly stipulated.* — The parties may validly enter into an agreement that violation of the terms of the contract would cause cancellation thereof even without judicial intervention or permission. (U.P. vs. De Los Angeles, 35 SCRA 102.) Where the contract itself contains such a stipulation, the right to rescind is not “implied” but expressly recognized by the parties. Hence, Article 1191 is not applicable.
    > However, there must be at least a written notice sent to the other party informing him of the rescission. The extra-judicial rescission has legal effect where such party does not oppose it. Where it is objected to, a determination of the issues by the court is still necessary. (Palay, Inc. vs. Clare, 124 SCRA 638.)
- (2) *Where contract still executory.* — Where there is no performance yet by both parties, but one is ready and willing to comply with what is incumbent upon him and the other is not (see last par., [[ARTICLE 1169]].), the willing party may, by his own declaration, rescind the contract without a previous judicial decree of rescission. In such a case, it is not necessary that there be stipulation providing for automatic rescission.
    > In any case, where the extrajudicial rescission is contested by the other party, he is free to resort to judicial action, and only the final decision of the court can finally settle whether the rescission was proper or not.
