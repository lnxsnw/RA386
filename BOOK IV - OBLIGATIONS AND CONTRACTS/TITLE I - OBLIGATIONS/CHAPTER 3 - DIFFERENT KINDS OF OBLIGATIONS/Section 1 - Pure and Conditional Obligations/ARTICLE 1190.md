### Effects of fulfillment of resolutory condition.
- (1) *In obligations to give.* — When the resolutory condition in an obligation to give is fulfilled, the obligation is extinguished ([[ARTICLE 1181]].) and the parties are obliged to return to each other what they have received under the obligation. (par. 2.)
    - (a) There is a return to the *status quo.* In other words, the effect of the fulfillment of the condition is retroactive.
    - (b) In case the thing to be returned is legally in the possession of a third person who did not act in bad faith (see par. 2, [[ARTICLE 1387]].), the remedy of the party entitled to restitution is against the other.
    - (c) The obligation of mutual restitution is absolute. It applies not only to the thing received but also to the fruits and interests.
    - (d) In obligations to give subject to *suspensive* condition, the retroactivity admits exceptions according as the obligation is bilateral or unilateral. (see [[ARTICLE 1187]].)

> The reason for the difference is quite plain. The happening of the suspensive condition gives birth to the obligation. On the other hand, the fulfillment of the resolutory condition produces the extinguishment of the obligation as though it had never existed. (see 8 Manresa 149-150.) The only possible exception is when the intention of the parties is otherwise. 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) X obliges himself allows Y to use the former’s car until X returns from the province. Upon the return of X from the province, Y must give back the car. 
> 
> > The effect of the happening of the condition is to *annul* the obligation as if it had never been constituted at all. In this case, the parties intend the return of the car.
> - (2) X binds himself to give Y P1,000 a month until Y passes the CPA examination. If Y passes the CPA examination, he need not return the amounts he has received. It is clear that the parties do not intend the return of the same.

- **(2) In obligations to do or not to do.** — In such obligations, the courts shall determine the retroactive effect of the fulfillment of the resolutory condition (par. 2.) as in the case where the condition is suspensive. (par. 2, [[ARTICLE 1187.]]) The courts in the exercise of discretion may even disallow retroactivity, taking into account the circumstances of each case.

### Applicability of Article 1189 to party with obligation to return.
In the first example above, X is the debtor and Y, the creditor, pending fulfillment of the resolutory condition — the return of X from the province. Upon the happening of the condition, X becomes the creditor with a right to demand the return of the car and Y, the debtor, with the obligation to return the car.

Stated in another way, the happening of a resolutory condition has the same effect on the creditor as the happening of a suspensive condition has on the debtor — an obligation arises. The fulfillment of the resolutory condition converts the creditor into debtor, and the debtor into creditor. Hence, the applicability of the provisions of [[ARTICLE 1189]] in case of loss, deterioration or improvement of the thing. Pending the fulfillment of the condition, the parties are entitled to the rights granted by [[ARTICLE 1188]].
