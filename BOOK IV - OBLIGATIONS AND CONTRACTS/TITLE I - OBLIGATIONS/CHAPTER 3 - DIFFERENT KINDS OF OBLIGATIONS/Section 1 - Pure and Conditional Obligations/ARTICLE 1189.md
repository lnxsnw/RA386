# When the conditions have been imposed with the intention of suspending the efficacy of an obligation to give, the following rules shall be observed in case of the improvement, loss or deterioration of the thing during the pendency of the condition: (1) If the thing is lost without the fault of the debtor, the obligation shall be extinguished; (2) If the thing is lost through the fault of the debtor, he shall be obliged to pay damages; it is understood that the thing is lost when it perishes, or goes out of commerce, or disappears in such a way that its existence is unknown or it cannot be recovered; (3) When the thing deteriorates without the fault of the debtor, the impairment is to be borne by the creditor; (4) If it deteriorates through the fault of the debtor, the creditor may choose between the rescission of the obligation and its fulfillment, with indemnity for damages in either case; (5) If the thing is improved by its nature, or by time, the improvement shall inure to the benefit of the creditor; (6) If it is improved at the expense of the debtor, he shall have no other right than that granted to the usufructuary. (1122)

## Book Contents

### Requisites for application of Article 1189.
Article 1189 applies only if:
- (1) The obligation is a real obligation;
- (2) The object is a specific or determinate thing;
- (3) The obligation is subject to a suspensive condition;
- (4) The condition is fulfilled; and
- (5) There is loss, deterioration, or improvement of the thing during the pendency of the condition.

### Kinds of loss.
Loss in civil law may be:
- (1) *Physical loss.* — when a thing perishes as when a house is burned and reduced to ashes;
- (2) *Legal loss.* — when a thing goes out of commerce (e.g., when it is expropriated) or when a thing heretofore legal becomes illegal (e.g., during the Japanese occupation, American dollars had become impossible since their use was forbidden by the belligerent occupant); or
- (3) *Civil loss.* — when a thing disappears in such a way that its existence is unknown (e.g., a particular dog has been missing for sometime); or even if known, it cannot be recovered (Art. 1189[2].), whether as a matter of fact (e.g., a particular ring is dropped from a ship at sea) or of law (e.g., a property is lost through prescription).

### Rules in case of loss, deterioration, or improvement of thing during pendency of suspensive condition.
- (1) *Loss of thing without debtor’s fault.* — 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X obliged himself to give Y his car worth P100,000 if Y will sell X’s property. The car was lost without the fault of X.
> The obligation is extinguished and X is not liable to Y even if Y sells the property. A person, as a general rule, is not liable for a fortuitous event. (Art. 1174.)

- (2) *Loss of thing through debtor’s fault.* 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> In the same example, if the loss occurred because of the negligence of X, Y will be entitled to demand damages ([[ARTICLE 1170]].), i.e., P100,000 plus incidental damages, if any.

- (3) *Deterioration of thing without debtor’s fault.* — A thing deteriorates when its value is reduced or impaired with or without the fault of the debtor.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> If the car figured in an accident, as a result of which its windshield was broken and some of its paints were scratched away without the fault of X, thereby reducing its value to P90,000, Y will have to suffer the deterioration or impairment in the amount of P10,000. (Art. 1174.)

- (4) *Deterioration of thing through debtor’s fault.* — 

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> In this case, B may choose between:
> - (a) *Rescission* (or cancellation) of the obligation with damages; in this case, X is liable to pay Y P100,000, the value of the car before its deterioration plus incidental damages, if any; or
> - (b) *Fulfillment* of the obligation also with damages. (see Art. 1191.) In this case, X is bound to give the car and pay P10,000 plus incidental damages, if any.

- (5) *Improvement of thing by nature or by time.* — A thing is improved when its value is increased or enhanced by nature or by time or at the expense of the debtor or creditor. (see Art. 1187.)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> Suppose the market value of the car increased, who gets the benefit?
> The improvement shall inure to the benefit of Y. Inasmuch as Y would suffer in case of deterioration of the car through a fortuitous event, it is but fair that he should be compensated in case of improvement of the car instead.

- (6) *Improvement of thing at expense of debtor.*

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> During the pendency of the condition, X had the car painted and its seat cover changed at his expense.
> 
> In this case, X will have the right granted to a usufructuary with respect to improvements made on the thing held in usufruct.

> *Usufruct* is the right to enjoy the use and fruits of a thing belonging to another. (Art. 562.)

> The rights granted to the usufructuary are:
> > “The usufructuary may make on the property held in usufruct such useful improvements or expenses for mere pleasure as he may deem proper provided he does not alter its form or substance; but he shall have no right to be indemnified therefor. He may, however, remove such improvements should it be possible to do so without damage to the property.” (Art. 579.)

> > “The usufructuary may set off the improvements he may have made on the property against any damages to the same.” (Art. 580.)
