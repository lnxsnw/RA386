### Rights pending fulfillment of suspensive condition.
- (1) *Rights of creditor.* — He may take or bring appropriate actions for the preservation of his right, as the debtor may render nugatory the obligation upon the happening of the condition. Thus, he may go to court to prevent the alienation or concealment of the property the debtor has bound himself to deliver, or to have his right annotated on the title to the property in the registry of deeds.

> The rule in paragraph one applies by analogy to obligations subject to a resolutory condition. (see par. 1, Art. 1190.)

- (2) *Rights of debtor.* — He is entitled to recover what he has paid by mistake prior to the happening of the suspensive condition. This right is granted to the debtor because the creditor may or may not be able to fulfill the condition imposed and hence, it is not certain that the obligation will arise. This is a case of *solutio indebiti* which is based on the principle that no one shall enrich himself at the expense of another.

> Note that the payment before the fulfillment of the condition must be “by mistake”; otherwise, the debtor is deemed to have impliedly waived the condition. In any case, he cannot recover what he has prematurely paid once the suspensive condition is fulfilled.
