### Effect of happening of condition.
This article reiterates the distinction between a suspensive (or antecedent) condition and a resolutory (or subsequent) condition.

- (1) *Acquisition of rights*. — In obligations subject to a suspensive condition, the acquisition of rights by the creditor depends upon the happening of the event which constitutes the condition.

> What characterizes this kind of obligation is the fact that its efficacy or obligatory force (as distinguished from its demandability) is subordinated to the happening of a future and uncertain event. It follows that if the suspensive condition does not take place and it is certain that it will not be fulfilled, the parties would stand as if the conditional obligation had never existed. During the pendency of the suspensive condition, the creditor has only a mere hope or expectancy of acquiring a right. (par. 1, [[ARTICLE 1188]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) T, testator, in his last will and testament gave some property to H (heir) provided T would die within two (2) years.
> In this case, H would acquire a right to the land only upon the happening of the suspensive condition: the death of T within two (2) years. (If there is no length of time within which the death must take place, the obligation is one with a period.) If T died after two (2) years, the situation would be the same as if no provision was made by T in his will in favor of H.
> (2) The surrender of the sweepstakes ticket is a condition precedent to the payment of the prize. (Santiago vs. Milla, 08 Phil. 39.)

- (2) *Loss of rights already acquired*. — In obligations subject to a resolutory condition, the happening of the event which constitutes the condition produces the extinguishment or loss of rights already acquired.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> - (1) X binds himself to support Y until Y graduates from a college. Here, the right already acquired by Y — the right to receive support — shall be extinguished or lost once the condition is fulfilled.
> - (2) S sold to B a parcel of land subject to S’s right of repurchase. The ownership already acquired by B under the contract shall be extinguished or lost should S exercise his right of repurchase.
> - (3) A lease contract expressly stipulates that R, lessor, may terminate the lease in case his children shall need the leased premises. Here, the happening of the condition depends upon the will of a third person — R’s children.
