## Book Contents

### Civil liability arising from crimes or delicts.
This article deals with civil liability for damages arising from crimes or delicts. ([[ARTICLE 1157]][4].)

- (1) Civil liability in addition to criminal liability. — Oftentimes, the commission of a crime causes not only moral evil but also material damage. From this principle, the rule has been established that every person criminally liable for an act or omission is also civilly liable for damages suffered by the aggrieved party. (see Art. 100, Revised Penal Code.)
- (2) Criminal liability without civil liability. — In crimes, however, which cause no material damage (like contempt, insults to persons in authority, gambling, violations of traffic regulations, etc.), there is no civil liability to be enforced.
- (3) Civil liability without criminal liability. — A person not criminally responsible may still be liable civilly ([[ARTICLE 29]]; [Sec. 2[c], Rule 111, Rules of Court](https://www.set.gov.ph/resources/revised-rules-of-court/2000-rules-of-criminal-procedure/).), such as failure to pay a contractual debt; causing damage to another's property without malicious or criminal intent or negligence, etc., or when the obligation arises from quasi-delict ([[ARTICLE 1162]].), not alleged and proved as a criminal offense.

### Scope of civil liability.
The extent of the civil liability for damages arising from crimes is governed by the Revised Penal Code and. the Civil Code. This civil liability includes:

- (1) Restitution;
- (2) Reparation for the damage caused; and
- (3) Indemnification for consequential damages. ([Art. 104, Revised Penal Code](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1930/12/08/act-no-3815-s-1930/).)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X stole the car of Y. If X is convicted, the court will order X: (1) to return the car or to pay its value if it was lost or destroyed; (2) to pay for any damage caused to the car; and (3) to pay such other damages suffered by Y as a consequence of the crime.
