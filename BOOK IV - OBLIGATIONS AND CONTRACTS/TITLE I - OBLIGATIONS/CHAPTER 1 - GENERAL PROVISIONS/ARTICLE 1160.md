## Book Contents

### Quasi-contractual obligations.
Article 1160 treats of obligations arising from quasi-contracts or contracts implied in law.

A *quasi-contract* is that juridical relation resulting from lawful, voluntary and unilateral acts by virtue of which the parties become bound to each other to the end that no one will be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another. ([[ARTICLE 2142]].)

It is not, properly, a contract at all. In contract, there is a meeting of the minds or consent (see [[ARTICLE 1318]], [[ARTICLE 1319]].); the parties must have deliberately entered into a formal agreement. In a quasi-contract, there is no consent but the same is supplied by fiction of law. In other words, the law considers the parties as having entered into a contract, although they have not actually done so, and irrespective of their intention, to prevent injustice or the unjust enrichment of a person at the expense of another.

### Kinds of quasi-contracts.
The principal kinds of quasi-contracts are *negotiorum gestio* and *solutio indebiti*.

- (1) *Negotiorum gestio* is the voluntary management of the property or affairs of another without the knowledge or consent of the latter. ([[ARTICLE 2144]].)

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > 
    > X went to Baguio with his family without leaving somebody to look after his house in Manila. While in Baguio, a big fire broke out near the house of X. Through the effort of Y, a neighbor, the house of X was saved from being burned. Y, however, incurred expenses.
    > 
    > In this case, X has the obligation to reimburse Y for said expenses, although he did not actually give his consent to the act of Y in saving his house, on the principle of quasi-contract.

- (2) *Solutio indebiti* is the juridical relation which is created when something is received when there is no right to demand it and it was unduly delivered through mistake. ([[ARTICLE 2154]].) It is based on the principle that no one shall enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another.

    > The requisites are:
    > - (a) There is no right to receive the thing delivered; and
    > - (b) The thing was delivered through mistake.

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > D owes C P1,000. If D paid T believing that T was authorized to receive payment for C, the obligation to return on the part of T arises. If D paid C P2,000 by mistake, C must return the excess of P1,000. The presumption (see [[ARTICLE 1176]].), however, is that “money paid by one to another was due to the latter,” unless the payor proves otherwise.

- (3) *Other examples of quasi-contracts*. — They are provided in Articles 2164 to 2175 of the Civil Code. The cases that have been classified as quasi-contracts are of infinite variety, and when for some reason recovery cannot be had on a true contract, recovery may be allowed on the basis of a quasi-contract.

    > [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
    > S, seller of goat's milk leaves milk at the house of B each morning. B uses the milk and places the empty bottles on the porch. After one (1) week, S asks payment for the milk delivered.
    >
    > Here, an implied contract is understood to have been entered into by the very acts of S and B, creating an obligation on the part of B to pay the reasonable value of the milk, otherwise, B would be unjustly benefited at the expense of S.
