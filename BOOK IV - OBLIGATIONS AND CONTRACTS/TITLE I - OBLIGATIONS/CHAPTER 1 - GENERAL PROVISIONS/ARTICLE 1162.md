### Obligations arising from quasi-delicts.
The above provision treats of obligations arising from quasi-delicts or torts. (see Arts. 2176 to 2194.)

A *quasi-delict* is an act or omission by a person (tortfeasor) which causes damage to another in his person, property, or rights giving rise to an obligation to pay for the damage done, there being fault or negligence but there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties. ([[ARTICLE 2176]].)

### Requisites of quasi-delict.

Before a person can be held liable for quasi-delict, the following requisites must be present:

- (1) There must be an act or omission;
- (2) There must be fault or negligence;
- (3) There must be damage caused;
- (4) There must be a direct relation or connection of cause and effect between the act or omission and the damage; and
- (5) There is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties.


> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE
> While playing softball with his friends, X broke the window glass of Y, his neighbor. The accident would not have happened had they played a little farther from the house of Y.
> 
> In this case, X is under obligation to pay the damage caused to by his act although there is no pre-existing contractual relation between them because he is guilty of mere fault or negligence without any criminal intent.

### Crime distinguished from quasi-delict.
The following are the distinctions:

- (1) In crime, there is criminal or malicious intent or criminal negligence, while in quasi-delict, there is only negligence;
- (2) In crime, the purpose is punishment, while in quasi-delict, indemnification of the offended party;
- (3) Crime affects public interest, while quasi-delict concerns private interest;
- (4) In crime, there are generally two liabilities: criminal and civil, while in quasi-delict, there is only civil liability;
- (5) Criminal liability can not be compromised or settled by the parties themselves, while the liability for quasi-delict can be compromised as any other civil liability; and
- (6) In crime, the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond reasonable doubt,[^2] while in quasi-delict, the fault or negligence of the defendant need only be proved by preponderance (i.e., superior or greater weight) of evidence.

[^2]: The evidence must be pretty clear and convincing as will engender belief in an unprejudiced mind that the accused is really guilty.
