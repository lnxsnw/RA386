### Legal obligations.
Article 1168 refers to legal obligations or obligations arising from law. They are not presumed because they are considered a burden upon the obligor. They are the exception, not the rule. To be demandable, they must be clearly set forth in the law, i.e., the Civil Code or special laws. Thus:

- (1) An employer has no obligation to furnish free legal assistance to his employees because no law requires this, and therefore, an employee may not recover from his employer the amount he may have paid a lawyer hired by him to recover damages caused to said employee by a stranger or strangers while in the performance of his duties, ([[De la Cruz vs, Northern Theatrical Enterprises, 95 Phil. 739]].)
- (2) A private school has no legal obligation to provide clothing allowance to its teachers because there is no law which imposes this obligation upon schools. But a person who wins money in gambling, has the duty to return his winnings to the loser. This obligation is provided by law. ([[ARTICLE 2014]].)

Under Article 1158, *special laws* refer to all other laws not contained in the Civil Code. Examples of such laws are Corporation Code, Negotiable Instruments Law, Insurance Code, National Internal Revenue Code, Revised Penal Code, Labor Code, etc.
