### Contractual Obligations.
The above article speaks of contractual obligations or obligations arising from contracts or voluntary agreements. It presupposes that the contracts entered into are valid and enforceable.

A *contract* is a meeting of minds between two (2) (or more) persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service. ([[ARTICLE 1305]].)

- (1) *Binding force*. — Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties, i.e., they have the same binding effect of obligations imposed by laws. This does not mean, however, that contract is superior to the law. As a source of enforceable obligation, contract must be valid and it cannot be valid if it is against the law.
- (2) *Requirement of a valid contract*. — A contract is valid (assuming all the essential elements are present; Art. 1318.) if it is not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, and public policy. It is invalid or void if it is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. (Art. 1306.)

	In the eyes of the law, a void contract does not exist. ([[ARTICLE 1409]].) Consequently, no obligations will arise. A contract may be valid but cannot be enforced. This is true in the case of unenforceable contracts. (see Arts. 1317, 1403.)

- (3) *Breach of contract*. — A contract may be breached or violated by a party in whole or in part. A breach of contract takes place when a party fails or refuses to comply, without legal reason or justification, with his obligation under the contract as promised.

### Compliance in good faith.
*Compliance in good faith* means compliance or performance in accordance with the stipulations or terms of the contract or agreement. Sincerity and honesty must be observed to prevent one party from taking unfair advantage over the other.

Non-compliance by a party with his legitimate obligations after receiving the benefits of a contract would constitute unjust enrichment on his part. Although a contract provides no penalty for its violation, a party cannot breach it with impunity. The oppressed party is afforded remedies to protect his rights. (see [[ARTICLE 1191]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLES:
> (1) If S agrees to sell his house to B and B agrees to buy the house of S, voluntarily and willingly, then they are bound by the terms of their contract and neither party may, upon his own will, and without any justifiable reason, withdraw from the contract or escape from his obligations thereunder.
>
> That which is agreed upon in the contract is the law between S and B and must be complied with in good faith.
>
> (2) A contract whereby S will kill B in consideration of P1,000 to be paid by C, is void and non-existent because killing a person is contrary to law. Likewise, an agreement whereby S will render domestic service gratuitously until his loan to B is paid, is void as being contrary to law and morals. (see [[ARTICLE 1689]]; [[De los Reyes vs. Alejado, 16 Phil. 499]].)
>
> In both cases, S has no obligation to comply with his agreements.
