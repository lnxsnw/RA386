### Meaning of obligation.
The term obligation is derived from the Latin word *obligatio* which means *tying* or *binding*.
It is a tie or bond recognized by law by virtue of which one is bound in favor of another to render something — and this may consist in giving a thing, doing a certain act, or not doing a certain act.
### Civil Code definition.
Article 1156 gives the Civil Code definition of obligation, in its passive aspect. It merely stresses the duty under the law of the debtor or obligor (he who has the duty of giving, doing, or not doing) when it speaks of obligation as a juridical necessity.
### Meaning of juridical necessity.
Obligation is a *juridical necessity* because in case of noncompliance, the courts of justice may be called upon to enforce its fulfillment or, in default thereof, the economic value that it represents. In a proper case, the debtor or obligor may also be made liable for *damages*, which represent the sum of money given as a compensation for the injury or harm suffered by the creditor or obligee (he who has the right to the performance of the obligation) for the violation of his rights.

In other words, the debtor must comply with his obligation whether he likes it or not; otherwise, his failure will be visited with some harmful or undesirable consequences. If obligations were not made enforceable, then people can disregard them with impunity. They are, however, obligations that cannot be enforced because they are not recognized by law as binding.
### Nature and obligations under the Civil Code.
Obligations which give to the creditor or obligee a right under the law to enforce their performance in courts of justice are known as *civil obligations*. They are to be distinguished from *natural obligations*, which, not being based on positive law but on equity and natural law, do not grant a right of action to enforce their performance although in case of voluntary fulfillment by the debtor, the latter may not recover what has been delivered or rendered by reason thereof. ([[ARTICLE 1423]])

Natural obligations are discussed under the Title dealing with "Natural Obligations." (Title III, Arts. 1423-1430.)
### Essential requisites of an obligation.
Every obligation has four (4) essential elements, namely:
- (1) A *passive subject* (called debtor or obligor) — the person who is bound to the fulfillment of the obligation; he who has a duty;
- (2) An *active subject* (called creditor or obligee) — the person who is entitled to demand the fulfillment of the obligation; he who has a right;
- (3) *Object or prestation* (subject matter of the obligation) — the conduct required to be observed by the debtor. It may consist in giving, doing, or not doing. Without the prestation, there is nothing to perform. In bilateral obligations (see [[ARTICLE 1191]].), the parties are reciprocally debtors and creditors; and
- (4) *A juridical or legal tie* (also called efficient cause) — that which binds or connects the parties to the obligation. The tie in an obligation can easily be determined by knowing the source of the obligation. ([[ARTICLE 1157]].)

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> Under a building contract, X bound himself to build a house for Y for P1,000,000.
> 
> Here, X is the passive subject, Y is the active subject, the building of the house is the object or prestation, and the agreement or contract, which is the source of the obligation, is the juridical tie
> 
> Suppose X had already constructed the house and it was the agreement that Y would pay X after the construction is finished, X then becomes the active subject and Y, the passive subject.

### Forms of Obligations.
The *form of an obligation* refers to the manner in which an obligation is manifested or incurred. It may be oral, or in writing, or partly oral and partly in writing. —
- (1) As a general rule, the law does not require any form for obligations arising from contracts for their validity or binding force. (see [[ARTICLE 1356]].)
- (2) Obligations arising from other sources ([[ARTICLE 1157]].) do not have any form at all.
### Obligation, right, and wrong distinguished.
- (1) *Obligation* is the act or performance which the law will enforce.
- (2) *Right*, on the other hand, is the power which a person has under the law, to demand from another any prestation.
- (3) A *wrong* (cause of action), according to its legal meaning, is an act or omission of one party in violation of the legal right or rights (i.e., recognized by law) of another. In law, the term *injury* is also used to refer to the wrongful violation of the legal right of another.

The essential elements of a legal wrong or injury are:
- (a) a legal right in favor of a person (creditor/obligee/plaintiff);
- (b) a correlative legal obligation on the part of another (debtor/obligor/defendant); to respect or not to violate said right; and
- (c) an act or omission by the latter in violation of said right with resulting injury or damage to the former.

An obligation on the part of a person cannot exist without a corresponding right in favor of another, and vice-versa. A wrong or cause of action only arises at the moment a right has been transgressed or violated.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> In the preceding example, Y has the legal right to have his house constructed by X who has the correlative legal obligation to build the house of X under their contract. X has the right to be paid the agreed compensation provided the house is built according to the terms and conditions of the contract.
> 
> The failure of either party to comply with such terms and conditions gives the other a cause of action for the enforcement of his right and/or recovery of indemnity for the loss or damage caused to him for the violation of his right.

### Kinds of obligation according to the subject matter.
From the viewpoint of the subject matter, obligation may either be real or personal.
- (1) *Real obligation* (obligation to give) is that in which the subject matter is a thing which the obligor must deliver to the obligee.

> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
> X (e.g., seller) binds himself to deliver a piano to Y (buyer).

- (2) *Personal obligation* (obligation to do or not to do) is that in which the subject matter is an act to be done or not to be done. There are two (2) kinds of personal obligation:
	- (a) *Positive personal obligation* or obligation to do or to render service, (see [[ARTICLE 1167]].) 

		> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
		> X binds himself to repair the piano of Y.

	- (b) *Negative personal obligation* is obligation not to do (which naturally includes obligations “not to give”). (see [[ARTICLE 1168]].)

		> [!NOTE] EXAMPLE:
		> X obliges himself not to build a fence on a certain portion of his lot in favor of Y who is entitled to a right of way over said lot.
